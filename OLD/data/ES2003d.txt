0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 should hopefully do a trick.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry about this small delay.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going a little bit behind schedule.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to go for something.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 How was it the new black of a leaf?

0:00:49	SPEAKER_01
 Something that looks good because that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, but we should never avoid functionality of course.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 Many of our components are going to be standard off the shelf, but it seemed like we were going to require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an LCD display.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 Other things where we were hoping to use rubber, most likely going to be double curved, etc.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so due to your hard work we might as well let the two designers go first and show us the prototype.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's right.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 Why, how the best way to do this is I'm not sure, but...

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you, both.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 Step up and outline our ideas.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Now, doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 For one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is down here for the LED as it turned out.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 The whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons in joystick.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 So it might be an idea to be able to adjust the position as with the base of the joystick just a little bit.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, perhaps I just thought you could simply have a slightly over-oiled shaped joystick that could then just be turned on a twisted round so that the stickier...

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 But as you see with the holding it on the left hand, the LCD is nowhere useful, so that would need to be articulated.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 If we're going to retain ergonomic design.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 I got your note about keeping the cost down.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 I'll say, yeah.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_01
 We'll go into that a bit more, but it's not.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 This design could be done with plastic casing, though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having to be just a rubber grip over that, which would allow for a slightly more bio-market form and a bit more ergonomic as well.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 As for the single curve, well, this edge and this edge, like I said, would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 Really the curve that's mostly needed is the underside so that the joystick rests over the edge of the hand like this.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Then you have the transmitter here.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 No mean speaker for the remote control finder.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 Any further comment?

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously it's going to be bulkier than it looks because it's going to be flat on one side, so the LCD will stick down like this one.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_03
 Because we can't get a curve.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean that it costs and it's plastic as well, so it'll be as comfortable on the hand.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 And with the rubber design, it could pretty much mould very much to the user's hand.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 One nice feature if we could still do the rubber.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the rigid substructure.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 It has a sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 Absolutely.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's it.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, yeah, great.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've got a few load up my evaluation.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 We'll go for it.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent work.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically, we'll have a list of criteria that we need to rate their prototype by.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 Then we will, it's a seven step kind of evaluation process.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, not seven steps, seven scale.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, after we finish doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that and that would give us some type of confidence in our prototype.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 And the criteria were based on real reactions, kind of goals and policies, marketing strategies, and also those are put together from the user requirements.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, if you put the.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, those are the criteria.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps I could put them a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product was scored very badly on some of those points.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have them.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Seven, eight.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we have to go through each point.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 We imagine it's actually straight and just give it a school.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, how well would you say the prototype is how well we realize the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost or to able to find them once they lost. I mean, is their home and things still the locator that's still.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's still part of the design.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, and Adam, we can keep that in.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I believe so.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, I mean, I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost because that would mean doing something a bit human.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 But I'd like to think that we've done something about finding a damn thing once we have.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 And making it a bright color helps.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 Personally, I would have gone for purple.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 Bright color.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 So, we still have that noise being done.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 On a scale of one to seven, how would you guys rate it for finding it once it's lost?

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say number one.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 Number one?

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 Number one for the first criteria.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think if it was just the sounder, then there's something I found with, what was he trying to find, the cardless phone on mobile.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 You can hear it, but you can't quite pin it down where it is.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can tell what the mobile is.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 What about the volume on the TV's turned up massively?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 And this one I turned down the volume you can't find the remote.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Suppose you have to go to the TV and do a manual.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't hear that it's speaking.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Just before we go through all of the steps.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 You want to see something here?

0:08:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what we'll do is, if we can look at the criteria you're going to evaluate and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's all right.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's the first one.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 So is there anything here that you wanted to cover as a criteria that you've covered?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll come back pretty much properly to this.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Where's the main...

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any explaining or is there anything that you thought that really would stand out compared to the others?

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 A few.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 Some have got neglected from my initial research is that rural reactions has a goal strategy that all of their products be inspired by interior fashion and clothing fashion.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 That is why food and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 And they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends and fashion.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 So they say we put the fashion and electronics where they really mean it.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 They're very big on fashion.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 That's this bit right here.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_02
 And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's just the same as saying it's easy to use interface.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 So we're kind of condensed into one.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 And we can come back to it.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 You said so.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 And which we will do very, very shortly.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Slate problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Most of it stems from the use of the LCD, which I think in the end accounted for about half of our extended trip because of course we required a chip as well.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 The only way to get this down was either to ditch the LCD, at which point we removed a large part of how we were going to interface with the requirement buttons, etc.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 Or what we did was that we, as an eyes of quickly going over it was altering the actual structure.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 Changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curved design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 And we're just scraping it in.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 We've got point two of a euro left over there.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 So we're just managing it really.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 Even then as well.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 There was no criteria technically defined for a joystick.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I've used what I think is appropriate with any luck.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 That won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 For example, the possibility of having a USB connection is definitely not all valuable now.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Different languages.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 That should still be viable.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 We've got an advanced chip.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 We've got the use of the LCD.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 But what's something we need to decide on is how we're going to go from here.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 Looking now can bring the Excel sheet up and show you if you wish.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 I really think as much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design possibly meaning that the LCD wouldn't be in this perfect place.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 It might be slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for the right handed person.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose one thing that could be done is have it circular and so that the pink is actually goes a bit over the pinky finger.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 So it very much is about making concessions unfortunately.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design?

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 I have as much information as I do.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 So as you can see here for example the battery really not very little choice in that one.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 We've gone from one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're going to do what we're needing to.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic for some reason occurs no cost which I've had to very much make advantage of despite the fact that robbers only got a value to euros per unit.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Problem comes here as you can see in the interface.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 If I've read this incorrectly then you can save 0.5 of a euro here and it's not per push button.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 That might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at 4.5 euros which is an awful lot so that could well be wrong.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 Even if we save 0.5 there it would just mean it was most likely placing it and actually just gaining a color for the unit which we set to be put to some one side.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see the use of an LC display advanced chip and what would determine a scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated school school push button.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't quite what I think they had in mind really joystick.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 Why would that be more expensive than an individual push button? A scroll wheel together?

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's quite significantly expensive.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's something I have to take up with the bean counters.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see that's taken up well over half the price.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go but because we need to shed what was for euros off of the price of what we really desired.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 This one comes in on the price as you can see but this was the one that sacrificed the curio for the case and for the actual case design.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 We don't even have speakers here.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 What about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? I really like to tell them.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_01
 I know we haven't.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 We have to receive our speakers plus the extra device itself that's going to be on the TV.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 It literally would be a button.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 We might have to express them.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like almost nothing.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 No good call.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 I mean it's not on here but I'm doing a very valid point.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have to use an advanced chip for the LCD?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 That's...

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 So if we're going to go with the LCD display then that's...

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 What's that hand down?

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 Dynamo.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 You have to wind it up?

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like so yeah.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 That would probably not be in keeping with the fashion statement.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 This is basically the only new thing is the LCD on the...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 Manipulated by the joystick here.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just...

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 Which I'm defining as scroll wheel.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 And we couldn't replace the joystick quite because we would need to pull extra buttons to replace it up down left and right and that would be more expensive than it.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 But is the scroll wheel not just back and forth?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that...

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I've labeled it for, purposes of this evaluation.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 The LCD basically is the big selling point of...

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 If we remove the LCD display we could save ourselves a fair amount.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 Which you can't sort of make original but...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_00
 If we remove the LCD display then there would absolutely no point to any of these meetings.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 But we just put our branding on any other remote control.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's a shame we should possibly...

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 If we could have increased the price we could have manufactured that and then we could have got some...

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
 Part closer to what we were.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 Does this open to you?

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Does this bear in mind that...

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're going to charge us.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 Was it like this much money for three million if we're going to buy three million components?

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Again, you'll have to argue the accountants on that one.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 But for the purposes of this meeting we're going to have to stick with these figures.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're going to keep the LCD display because it's about what really separates us.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's like the cost it's going to incur.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 Our people maybe not happy with but are willing to go ahead with this and go in for a plastic solid case to keep the LCD.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 I'm one thing I...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 How much extra would it be to keep the articulation?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard to tell. I would say that you're at least going to take double curved and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think that it didn't require it to be double curved.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it could still be single curved but it's just a little bit of articulation.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's just that the case would come into it and would be made in two parts and then join together with an articulation.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 Could we not get rid of the curved base and focus on the menu being the best interface?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have restrictions on software?

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's what you need for the joystick.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, but it has to be.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you look closer at the prototype here, the lines here along grip are actually quite straight.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 But the curve's all over the hand, is it?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, on the LCD, I mean, although we've done it with the curve, it could just as easily be done without curves.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 The curve that's really needed is up here to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position without to have it rest on the top of the hand.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, my bad.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, I mean, for the purposes of this meeting, maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Unless we hear otherwise, we could go ahead with that proposal.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 The product is not going to perform so well for my criteria.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Which is what we can get on to now.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 As long as, so we're going to say, we'll have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're going to say, um, Oh, wait a minute.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Single curve design sample speaker.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 What is the sample speaker?

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 Is that somewhat similar to what we want?

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 It could well be the end of the course.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 That voice response thing.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 I forgot the email about.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was just completely pointless.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 You got an email about voice response?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 I did not.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 But basically, it's saying that your labs had come up with a chip that you could say hello to and it would say hello back in a friendly female.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 We'll definitely won't go with that one.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 We won't go with that one.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, that's voice recognition.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_02
 Um, so, okay.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Battery definitely.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 So it looks like we're going to get rid of the whole locate locator.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like unless we can manage to put it in under point two years.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe even slick.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, no, you have pretty much point two euros, I'd say.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll leave that one for now.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Also, we don't for a special color at all.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's a case of, um, I'm slightly unsure.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 One point five of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 Um, well, at which point for a case.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you already incorporated that.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, special color for the case.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you got point five there.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not quite sure if they're, I don't think they mean point five euros per button.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's say that and then we can have our special color case and then we at least have.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 Make it a little harder to lose.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 Because most, most remotes are a fairly dingy color that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 What's the default color, white or black?

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 Black probably normal color you'd see gray.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 I quite like that color that you're fetching now.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's definitely make it glow in the dark even better.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, will we go with that then?

0:22:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's not and we can see, we'll come back.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 You're evaluation in which you're probably now going to pan us.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, uh, just to give you an idea, um, you'll want to go maybe a bit quickly as well.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how much time we've not hit the five minute mark.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_03
 We're working yet, but okay.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Ability to start remote some ring gloss.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 Let's find them once they lost.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 Um, okay.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Special color.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, four, four, three, three, we're being generous.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can do three, three.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_00
 We're being generous here with a special color.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_00
 What I think make a difference.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 It makes it stand out from, you know, it's lost in a big pile of crap.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 It stands out from the rest of the crap.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 We'd use the number of one use buttons.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 We're down to two buttons.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 Two buttons.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 So that's a one, you know, we're, that's.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'd say we're doing well there.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 That was good.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to use interface buttons.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Many, many is cool.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's good.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 That's when I've done so badly.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to use.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Let's forget that one.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 Fancy looking.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't get much.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 We could do whatever we like with the LCD.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 Let's just assume it's a good LCD display.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I was panicking for no reason.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'll tell you go to because like the fans used to work the door.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a bit.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 With the articulators.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's better.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 To more accurate numbers.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 No logically innovative.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we're getting rid of the locator thing, which is a shame.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 Which, yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't need for this for that.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 Free.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 And the menus thing is something you don't normally see on a remote.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 You see it in a lot of other places.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Mobile phones.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 And what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control source.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 You say free?

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 I might go as far as two on that.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_02
 Free.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to 10, 2, 3.

0:24:48	None
 OK.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 And the next one anyway.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 There are some people find pleasing.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 Spungyness is what they really would have wanted.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 Don't blame them.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 Because of the way that we've minimized the number of buttons and such.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 It sucks.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 But it's no worse than any of the other remote controls they have.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a step backwards.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_00
 I give it a six.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 Let's give it a six.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's totally from everything with balance.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 We could.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 What color will we going to make it?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Leopard print on it.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_00
 I would say give us a selection of colors.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yellow for the prototype.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 If I were buying one, I'd go for the particle.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 Leopard print would be cool.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's more OK.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 The color of the border there.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's fine.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's not standard.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 That yellow.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 It would also help keep the product placement local.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 But they're referring to the fruit and veg thing.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_02
 Is this like a banana type color?

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 Could we stretch?

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 No, there's no shape like a banana.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of dope.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 It won't be when it's been.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, like because it's flat.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 What is this?

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 Fruit.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's just flat.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is not particularly fruit and veg.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 We might have to suffer badly for this one as well.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things that are fruit and veg.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 So, what?

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Four?

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's very ambitious.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criteria.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 The sole criteria for being.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 Inspired by the way.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Action for inspired by current passions.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 I can't wait to start with that.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 This is their motto.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is their strategy.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invested is going to be proportional to the marks.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 Might want to be a bit more skeptical about this one.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 What would you think, yourself?

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 I would say, I mean, it's not at all.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 In any way of shape or form.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 And that's pretty much banana-like.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow banana light fingers.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's okay.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's got a curve to it.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 Is that so unreadable?

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not stretching the use of a banana.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty one.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_02
 This gives us an average of three.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this would be in the middle.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not bad.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's in a good section.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's not bad and considering the...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 Don't break the fan.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oops.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 What are you not badly scared of?

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's bad to design that.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 Considering the price we have to get this in, we have a positive, you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 It was going to be quite hard to get anything standing out, I'd say, possibly, based on the cost teachers.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_02
 Even if we were to increase this entire thing by seven, we were to go down a grade to four, we would have to do...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we weren't that kind of optimistic, too overly optimistic, you know, like we didn't add, we didn't subtract our whole seven points from the use of things.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we're definitely on the good bit.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven, that's still only three extra points over seven.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's...

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we did. It was okay. It was good.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 Personally, I think...

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Given that the product only replaces a single remote control that you already got, I think we're really going to show out 25 euros for something that's only marginally good.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, depends here, what the target people are, like you'd say.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe fashion conscious.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe women target.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, look at that. It's cool. It looks like a...

0:30:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's yellow. It looks like a banana. It's cool. It's got a look good in the sitting room.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 And rather than LCD, whereas more technical, like more people in the divideds technology, like as good as going on LCD screens.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 Only got two buttons and a joystick.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_03
 So which kind of people would be more likely to buy?

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 Probably the people technologically do. Usually it wants to buy pointless stuff.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, my mom still has not learned how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time. She uses it to make phone calls and that's it.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 So I think if my mom's a remote control like this, we're only two buttons and a joystick.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 She'd be like, is this a remote control? I don't...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 How do you use it and stuff like that?

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Even if it is really user friendly to us, but we're used to using menus all the time.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's one thing is that because it's technically innovative, for someone who's sort of technophobic, in fact, it simply looks unfamiliar or be daunting.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. I think it's totally radical to have a remote control, no numbered buttons.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 But like radical, good.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. I don't know how much longer we've got. At least five minutes, I think.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Quickly, we'll pop onto project evaluation.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 We've got these four criteria here for satisfaction.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 Does anybody want to...

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any opinions on any of them? For example, or backwards, I suppose, the ability to work in this project using the technology we've been presented with.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 These people made good use of the pen and paper.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_02
 I would say...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 I wrote Mary A. Page, but not.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a thing with digital pens, most of it.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the...

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 It goes into their corpus.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 That would have been nice to be able to transfer the paper notes onto the computer.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would have been pretty good.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 It does seem like paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe this is literally just the way I owned it.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 I heard people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_01
 As much as can be leader than this thing.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 I like that.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 Last one was about a group of creativity.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_00
 Until accounts came along.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're not lacking in ideas.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 That was not the problem.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think in the end ideas can be used and sadly is meaning not so much that we weren't full of ideas but of ones that are going to allow us to actually build the thing.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit of a pity.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 I would have to agree in that I think we needed a larger budget.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 If you're going to, in your product, maybe a technological kind of sector, then you can afford to maybe chat to price up slightly from what it is because they will pay out.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 They just cash the bevel.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think retaining the modern biomarker for the new articulation would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in added expense.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_03
 The price was twice the assembly cost.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 And would it have to be twice the, it could have had the assembly cost.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 It could still set up for 25.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's true.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose these are all, will have to be taken up with a different group, I guess, as to who the costs involved.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 But we've got a prototype.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's gone okay today considering the information that we've had at this point.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the accounts would have been better if we had a list to begin with.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 It probably would have, you could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 I would have to agree.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too extensive.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 Always hard to tell until you know the costs.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 So we're at a cost-within-budget, we are now that we have our slightly less than capable product.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 We've evaluated it and we can see we came out with a value of three.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 One thing I would say, I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product, the product testing and market research process would be to produce more cups of both versions and seeing just how much of a difference the over going over budget would make the sales.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and like response from consumers.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 We could even market two versions.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_00
 We keep you in a nice fine market.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then the final one where you get to call it how.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 Is there anything else that anybody would like to add?

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 Anything that's not been covered before I quickly write up a final report?

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, I mean we've got a product, we maybe aren't as happy with it as we like to be, but we've got something we think we can maybe stick on to the market and sell.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 And of course something we have been avoiding talking about because we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 There's a huge market.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean we briefly touched in it with no more knowledge than there's a little we can say on that.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_01
 So unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add, we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we need to and then we can finish up the writing in such.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you for your participation.

0:38:32	None
 Thank you.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 I was actually kind of upset at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 But man, we can't have the located thing.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a fact.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_02
 If it may be were the prices were made.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's a question you've been asking about.

0:39:04	None
 Okay.

0:39:09	None
 Okay.
