0:00:00	None
 Fright thataturdays WAIT I could it MMMMadd Oh Okay, good afternoon. Hope you have good lunch.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, three-hat for Luffle.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, nice.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 And you?

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I had something similar, but non-vegetarian.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so today is our third meeting.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_04
 This will be about the conceptual design.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 If I come back to the minutes of the last meetings, we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies, because of some reasons. And we are not decided about the use of the screen on the remote control because of costs.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we will be able to clarify this question today.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 At the end of the meeting, we should take a decision on that point.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_04
 So I hope that your respective presentations will help us.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 So each of you have some presentation to perform. Who starts?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we are starting.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_04
 Marketing. So you saved your presentation somewhere?

0:01:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_04
 So you're four?

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 Four, yeah.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_04
 Which is trend watch.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, Mr. Marketing Experts.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's me.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 So good point.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I investigate the preference more.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 I investigate deeper the preference of the users.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 Also the current investigation, sorry, the current.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Then current trends.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 Doesn't sound.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, what I found. Can you?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 Next slide.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Thank you. What I found in order of importance, from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 After they want something new, technologically speaking.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 But the most, what they find more interesting, more important is a fancy look and feel instead of the current trend, which was the functional look and feel.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 So now, more cool aspect, more, a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with, instead of, instead of a device which can do many things, a device which is pleasant to watch to see.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 Also, well, in Europe, in Paris and Milan, the, in Paris and Milan, the current trend of clothes, furniture and all this fashion, it's, it's free.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 And the, the theme is free time, vegetables.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 And also, in the, in the USA, the, the current, the more, the most popular feeling, it's, it's a spongy.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Spongy means, a pongy.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we should, we should think in, in this direction.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy?

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 What do you mean, it's like, fruit vegetables is the, the new, have you seen the last, exposition of clothes in Milan?

0:04:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, I missed that one.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I, I didn't miss an, I didn't miss an, I saw that the fruits, there are many pictures of fruits and vegetables in the world.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay. So they're not like dressed as a carrot, they just have, like, not yet.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Pictures of fruit on, okay.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 So we're not going to have a remote control in the shape of, of a banana just, maybe.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Visit all the textures and all this can,

0:05:15	SPEAKER_04
 Dreams of bananas.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. And, there. Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 But what's your suggestion, how we can have some shape like that on the, one?

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 One, so this is the next slide, so don't you?

0:05:28	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, it's not. It's not.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 So which fruit are you thinking of?

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 Mmm.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 Neither. I haven't thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the, of the remote control may, may, could remain some kind of vegetable, some kind of, instead of vegetable, some natural, natural, object of something.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_04
 But yeah, it depends on the, you can display a banana on the whole city.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the, this buttons are, the shape of fruits.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe the shape, the shape buttons are in the shape of fruits or something.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 Apple, banana, something like that.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 Not, not, not, not too much focus.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 Not too, not too, not too similar to a fruit because next year the, the trend, the trend will be different.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 So we shouldn't be really attached to, to the trend.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant?

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, yeah.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 African or Asian or African?

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 Let me just discuss that.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I'm not, I'm not really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 Just to fashion gurus.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 Like maybe just like a little bit, a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know about a, I don't know how ergonomic an origin.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should first specify what target are we focusing.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think in my opinion, we should focus on, on young people because they are more open to new devices.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 And also, yeah, according to the marketing report, 95% of young people was, was able to, to buy a, a cooler remote control.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 But this is, it's very cool.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_04
 What?

0:07:43	SPEAKER_04
 That's a question.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's very cool.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah?

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 What? It's the new trend of the...

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I guess, you know, Apple has their iPod so...

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 In my, just because they have an Apple on the, on the product doesn't mean fruit is cool.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think we should think about a shape with it.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 A device with the shape of some...

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but it has to be easy to, to use though and to hold, you know, you know, on a pair or a watermelon.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Then you think we can find a, the shape of a fruit which is handy?

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, probably the only thing is a banana.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think of a cucumber.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe it's log.

0:08:36	None
 Maybe.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's a green.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 So, but I mean, you also have to, you also have fit all the buttons and, you know, it's, it...

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 The thing is you have to, normally with, with buttons, they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 So if you're going to have things like on a cylindrical kind of device, it may be difficult to kind of, to build.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I like, I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 And you will not have play, a lot of plays to put LCD on a banana also.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, do you want an LCD with 25 euros?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you're a marketing expert.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 You should tell us if it's too much more.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Well, according to the, to the report, people are more interested in a fancy look and feel than in a technological innovation.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the...

0:09:43	SPEAKER_04
 So you, you...

0:09:45	SPEAKER_04
 You need to...

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 And also it's, I'm not convinced about this LCD because you need internet connection.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 You need more things.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's not just buying a new controlled remote.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 You need buying control remote, buying more things.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 So you are simply looking to...

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 A remote controlled that looks like a banana.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 For instance.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 For, for, given an example.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe you can go ahead.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no, it's what I already said.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'll give the floor.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 So you're using the big guy.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 So you're three.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_04
 And it's... this one.

0:10:33	None
 Yep.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 Go for it.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 So I received an email around lunchtime.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Let me know that the brilliant minds that our technology division have developed an integrated programmable sample, center sample speaker unit, which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a speaker, right?

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's no, what it is.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a microphone.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 It has a microphone, has a speaker, it's got a little chip.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 And last year...

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, I'm not reading microphone there, so that's why you can't have conversations.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's a sample.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's a big deal.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's a sensor sample speaker.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 It means that it can recognize, it can do like a match on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 But there's no kind of understanding of the phrase.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 So, I mean, you know, I guess you could build that in.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 You could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_02
 But basically the thing is we have this technology available.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 Enos.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 Enos.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 Enos.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, but the thing is obviously there's still going to be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production of the components.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 So, it, it, but it basically means we, we can kind of consider this from a, you know, a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about, you know, how to develop it because we have this already done.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 And, past, you know, some people might get annoyed if we, if we just dump it.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_04
 Something that I unclear really understanding.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_04
 Is this a technology that recognize keywords?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 Speech keywords?

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's, it's not, well, it's, it will recognize, I guess keywords, but, you know, keywords in a certain order, like a phrase.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 You train it for a certain, for a certain phrase, you say the, the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is, although they're actually integrating to the, into the coffee machine that, that web producing is, you can say good morning.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 The coffee machine, and it can recognize that phrase and it'll play back.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 How would you like your coffee?

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's just to play back something.

0:12:56	None
 Yeah.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 So actually that was a bad example because it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because they can't really understand the response.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So this is not really to do, to, to do control.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 Only, like, only in the sense that it can recognize the set, a set target kind of way.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 This is just more like a, it's designed, it's designed as a fun kind of thing, but I guess you could use it as a, as a way to implement a.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy, a fancy thing that you can bring to, we can bring to the remote control that we not have any.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 Completely pointless, yeah.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 Completely pointless.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_04
 From the interaction point of view.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 Unless you know you like having conversation with your remote control.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 Can we use it for saying, okay, channel 50, channel 20?

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if you can, but you have to, I think it's a fairly simple design.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 So you would have to record into the device every possible combination.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 You have to train it to learn channel 15, that whole thing, not just the word channel and the word 15.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't have that kind of logic in it.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_04
 So this is much more than taking this technology, bringing it to the remote control.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 There would be some development work.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 So this is out of discussion.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 So if it is something that we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 Mando.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 Banana Mando.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 Banana Mando.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_04
 Banana Mando, yeah.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 That, it could be cool.

0:14:31	None
 Yeah.

0:14:32	None
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go ahead.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 I, I, I, I think it's worth it.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's, it's, it's not mature enough to use as a speed tracking engine.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, yeah.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 So if we can just move on to the next slide, I've just done a quick mock up of, uh, some of the features of our potential front-key looking.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't look like a banana at all.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you see, I was, I was unaware at this point of, of the fruit focus.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 Um, so at the moment it looks like a box focus.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 You see now you can, I dropped, I dropped it on fruit.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is actually, this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be, you know, square so that it packs tighter in the boxes.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 But, um, I've just indicated here we could have actually two scroll wheels.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think the scroll wheel is a fairly, um, key part of, you know, I think everyone has the degree that it could be quite a useful, um, thing.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it's important, you know, to have two scroll wheels because, you know, you want one for, for the channel, but you also want one for the volume because it's, it's, the volume is, you know, it's very handy for it to have a instant kind of feedback and response.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, but, um, I also included this turbo button because I think, you know, every design should have a turbo button.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 What's the turbo button?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you see, this is, you know, a unique problem with, with televisions is that if you have this scroll wheel for the television, the, the tuner and the TV is not going to be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, the, the person might want to have a, uh, might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them, which gets it just waits until you stop scrolling and then, you know, displace that station.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 Or they might want to scroll and have a quick glimpse of it, even if it lags behind what they're doing.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 If you control the speed.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so with the turbo button, you can say skip over channels if, uh, you know, if I'm, if I'm going, if I'm scrolling past them and, you know, it's, um, you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel, you know, it's really going fast or whatever.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, that's, um, this is the two important features, I think we need on the right, but I mean, we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 Um, you know, it could be, you know, if we, if we want to have like a very cheap kind of device, I mean, we could even consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very, if it's going to be a banana, you know, as a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality is just, you know, it's going to be a little bit more functionality is just, you know, a couple of scroll wheels in the button because it's hard to get so many buttons on the banana and it's still very, it may even be for most, for some people more functional than their current remote, but if they have these scroll wheels so, um, you know, what other buttons do we want?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we could have, well, I guess you need an on and off switch, but you could, you could turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of like a spike and a flick. Sounds crazy. I like this idea. That's why you're a marketing. Yeah.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_04
 So it looks like we're going completely to forget about the LCD thing.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's the thing is every decided that we can only spend, uh, 25 year. I think we'll not spend, but, you know, charge.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could use somehow the coffee machine dialogue interface or so.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_04
 No, we can't, we can't use that.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 You, we can't, we can't use that to.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_04
 To command, to communicate is just to fit.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can say 2025. No. No.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 But then you have to have a template for every channel for 100 channels you have to be able to recognize.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's not allowed to 100 templates. Well, I, I think it's probably more than our chicken handle because it's designed for a coffee machine, you know, to say hello in the morning.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Ah, it's designed for a coffee machine.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's its current application. No, it's kind of, they wouldn't design it to handle 100 things.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. So maybe you could ask your, you could ask the engineering department.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Good. Good. Good thing. You want to move to your slides? You have finished?

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I just, I just made the point. I don't, I don't know that speech recognition is, you know, even if we can do it, I think it's not really appropriate for a.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 Television environment. But I did have one thing from a previous meeting you were talking about being able to find the remote control.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 And I was talking about extending, being able to extend the remote control by having, you know, a base station that can control other things as well.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it's just, you press on the button on it and the, and the remote control starts beeping.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 You know, this is a way of finding the remote.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 In that case, maybe the, maybe the speech recognition, the speech thing could be useful just to say, I'm here.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 But it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a, so it's a speech.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a, this is kind of thing. Something else. It's, it's just a spoken old.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's, it's speech in, in speech kind of, not really speech recognition, but kind of pattern.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's matching.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, good idea. Yeah.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 Make it.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Let's move on.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 So you too?

0:20:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 So this is going to be about the component design.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 So first thing is we need power source for the remote control.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies. One is the usual batteries, which are there.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 They could be chargeable batteries if there's a base station kind of thing.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 And on top of that, we can have solar cells. When the lighting conditions are good, they can be used.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 So it'd be pretty innovative kind.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your, if the remote control falls, it's not broken directly into pieces.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 There should be some flexibility in.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_02
 I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 So there should, we should think of something like that. And then it should be double curve the sides for the ease of handling.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 And there are some other issues why we need double curve.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Then controls for the traditional use, traditional users, we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 So this one second, when you say double curve, what do you actually mean? You're looking like drawers, I think, on the whiteboard.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Double curve is you have curves on both the sides if I'm right.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a metrical kind of thing, whatever it is.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but like, kind of convex.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 It could be curve. So it could be convex, convex, convex, depending on what we want.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 So there are flats, there are single curve and there are double curves.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 These are the three things. And there are different materials with plastic.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 You can have double curve, but with certain other materials, we cannot have double curve.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 So there were many other materials like wood, titanium and all those things, but plastic is, I think, is the most appropriate one.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 It'll bring the cost down. And anyway.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 Also, you know, wood could be quite a stylish option.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 If you take like, nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some, some varnish on it.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 But there is no elasticity. Which wood in pieces.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it depends. I mean, you have, the wood itself is not going to break.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 So you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken inside.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but inside, you know, you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the user.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 Very too expensive to do.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 And I mean, you can also, you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's true. But are we set on the banana idea?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, I was thinking that the shape of a banana is not, it's not really handy.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, it is.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know the name in English.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a free. It is a vegetable.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's like a pumpkin or?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 Pumpkin.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 Green.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Green.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 Green.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 I'm...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, I see.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 What is it?

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 And you put in the salad.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, what's it in French?

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's a...

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so it capsicum all of pepper.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_04
 Pepper.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 It also sweets with the double cure for easier.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, it seems a little bit kind of bulky for me.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, I mean, in a...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's not true.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 Like, you're a fancy and fancy and fun.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 You think that young people are...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sure it's fun.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 More than a banana?

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 But banana is not so handy.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's more handy.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's more than a rest compared to this, I think, and to capsicum.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, like a banana, you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just...

0:24:04	SPEAKER_02
 Roll it back and forth like that.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of...

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how you would hold a capsicum.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's really ergonomic.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 It fits in the hand.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 You had a lot of soft face to...

0:24:15	SPEAKER_04
 To put the control.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, let's move.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, all right.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, Stami is running.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so push buttons for the traditional user so that they don't feel they are alienated.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 Just...

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 And a scroll button with push technology for channel selection volume control and teletext browsing.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 In the company and we can go ahead with that.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can go to the next slide.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Then there are different kind of chips.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 One is the basic chip and then regular chip and then advanced chip.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we can have regular chip for control.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Pricing is a factor for us.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's why we'll go for the regular chip.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 And regular chip support, speaker support.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 So this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been missed.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, when you say speaker support, you mean it just has some output pins which kind of...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 It could be a beep kind of thing.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but the speaker is actually attached to the chip in some way or is it just the signal?

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, that's right.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's on to the chip.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 Most probably.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Not 100% shareable.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, are there any issues where we place this chip to make sure you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana?

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 That will be the volume control I think which a user...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 It should be already predefined.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 It should be whatever be the case, the chip is always going to be sitting inside.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the speaker is actually on the chip.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 Then if it's too far away from the casing or if the casing is too thick, then you may not hear the speaker.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 So we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 As far as hearing is concerned, we can have some gap at some place.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 So there's only have to keep in mind with the actual physical designers to keep the speaker close enough to the outside.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 So these were the components selection in these things.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 We can go to the next slide.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 And these were the findings which I saw with the web.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 That user wants to have control more than one device, wants to control more than one device from the same remote control.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 So our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV because users are like this that they don't want to have one remote control for everything.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 With this additional little, we might be having slightly better market for us.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 It depends.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 If we are concentrating on a fruit design, then maybe we want to sell a collection of fruit.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 You have a different fruit for each device.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 Because sometimes people like to collect more things that are similar.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think that would be funny at the beginning, but after one month, you will be tired of being surrounded of fruit.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you still only wanted to do fruit in the first place.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 No, but I think just one fruit to control everything.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Like a power fruit.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 A power, a power, a mando, a super mando fruit.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 And as well as I could see on the web, there is crawl button is becoming really a hot thing.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 And we should have it on the remote.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 So you are having a base station.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 Usually your remote sits on that.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's why it can have chargeable batteries.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 Now let's say you have to buy two things.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 The banana and the base station.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 Base station is with the thing.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 You bought the war thing.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a telephone handset is there and the base station for the telephone handset is there.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 So now what user gets additionally, he doesn't have to buy batteries.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 They are rechargeable batteries.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 So all the period of time he will recover the cost.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 So you are having the base station and there is a button.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 If you press that button, wherever the remote it will start beeping.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 So you know where the remote is.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a pretty handy feature.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's kind of people would find it worth it even if it wasn't a recharging station.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 Even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_00
 I'm worried about the budget.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 This is base station is nothing more just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 And you are having one socket on which the thing sits.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 I thought you do need to include RF kind of.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 But all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 So component cost is going to be the least.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we are not using very advanced technology.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 LCD has already been ruled out.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 ASR has been ruled out.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just wondering actually because you know this whole fruit thing with the banana.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's like a first seems a bit kind of niche.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 Many people would really want a banana.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 But what if it was kind of a stylised banana?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 Rather than having it kind of yellow and really looking exactly like a banana.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 It could make it kind of silver.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 And to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking completely kitsch.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 One for better word.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_04
 You're using a yellow as kitsch.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how many people.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 You make some things that look like a banana.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 You can have the colour of a banana.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you don't get anything.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like that.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's neither of a banana nor a.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like this colour.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe, you know, maybe like still in the shape of a banana.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_04
 Roughly.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 No, exactly.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 But you know, just maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 And just kind of, you know, because the thing is it's going to be a little bit difficult to make.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 To give like the texture of a banana anyway and to have the exact shape.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think if you're going to not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 That just looks a bit more kind of, you know, 21st century rather than 60 or 70s.

0:30:28	None
 Okay.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 Let's move on.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 Going to the last slide.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 Before ending the meeting I'd like to draw some sketch about the future prototype.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_03
 Go for it.

0:30:41	None
 Okay.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no, not you.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 You can finish your slides.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway, users will be, so the findings is users will be very interested in our locator divide to find their misplaced amounts.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 So that was very, I thought it's a very suggestion by everybody.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 That's all.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 So we're done for the presentations.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_04
 So we need to take some decisions about what we're going to do.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_04
 So I propose that you go to the whiteboard.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_04
 And we're going to report all the ideas we had during these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the final product and our super mango banana.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 And with the basis extra functionalities such as wheels, the speaker you need, well, not too lost the device.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember what you call it.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 The basis station.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 Basis station, yeah.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going for a stylish banana shape.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So I guess you want to hold like the way the end of the banana you want to kind of hold.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 You may want to kind of hold like a gun rather than because you don't want to point kind of towards the floor.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, so if you have like.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_00
 What about what are these shape more or less?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there's less space on this to put the buttons.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if it has really more of a banana, you could the starting is good, but it could it should have more of a shape of a banana if you want to point really.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_04
 I just think if you don't want to do that that movement, which is which is difficult, if you don't have to do it, in fact, it's better.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 So that time is running. We have to move forward.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 So let's skip to this this this this idea.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Okay. So.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 So we have this we have a basis. How do you call it?

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 The base station. A base station. We'll have a base station extra on the side.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So I guess we need, you know, something that can fit a banana shaped object.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Yeah. We have a RF for for beating.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 That's right. Yeah.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_04
 For beating. We need RF to be.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, so that means we need a button on the basis.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Basis station.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 Basis station. Thank you.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_02
 All right. So we need.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 Can you go quickly please? Okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 So we are going to add also your as you suggested, the wheels, some wheels to control the volumes and channels.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. And your turbo, turbo.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the device.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. So you have maybe here and the wheel at the level of the thumb, for instance.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So you have the thumb kind of here and you have two wheels.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah. You need one one here and one on the other side.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Right. So you get volume and channel. Good. And so no LCD.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 No LCD. Okay. Great.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 Very good. Okay. Oh, we need we need a power on off switch as well.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. For the remote. Yeah.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_04
 Just don't have power. No, no for the TV for the TV.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So you know that will be controlled by the buttons will be there already.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Where? Means on the side.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because remote is going to have both the interfaces, scroll as well as buttons.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 They are not going to cost you much.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 Everything is in house and now you don't want the traditional users to be.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_02
 Apprehensive of this. Well, I don't know if the traditional user is going to buy a.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_02
 Up and on a remote. Oh, the first place. Yes.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 That's that's another issue. I mean, you need to kind of keep it.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 But you know, our targets are very high means 50 million euros is the profit.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 Which we want to talk about. Yeah. How many of these to be one or so?

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 I can't remember. 25. 25 is the profit on one.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. But how many units did we need to sell?

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 44 million. 4 million. 4.4 million.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_02
 0.4 million. That's a lot of fruit.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. In the market. What about so?

0:35:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no time is running. We have to close the meeting in a few minutes.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay. The next step you can come back to sit.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 The next step is to go for is to go to building a prototype based on this.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Okay. So next meeting you guys have to prefer the fully things.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 You have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, you two, you have to work together to model the first prototype.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 Marketing expert has to go to product evaluation.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. What about adding this key word spot in recognition saying volume up, volume down?

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's too difficult. It's too difficult. But people like innovation.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_00
 And that's really innovative. And I don't know if it would cost a lot.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 There's a few, five words.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's not possible to implement it for the next prototype. So it's in the next prototype.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 So let's keep it. Okay. For the future of prototypes.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Maybe. If it works well, we will go for the range of banana plus plus.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. First, yeah. Yeah. All other fruit.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you. Thank you.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you. Thank you.
