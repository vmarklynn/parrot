0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, things are expensive.

0:00:04	None
 Form blah blah, bite.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_04
 In other words.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Got it, we don't have any changes, do we?

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 So no.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:16	None
 There we go.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, here we are again.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 Detail design.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, come on.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I forgot to insert the minutes, but it's about the same thing we discussed before.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 It opened anyway, I think.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_01
 Other design.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we took rubber as the material last time.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 We also know that you just been busy with it.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 Took the advanced shift, to implement the advanced features.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we discussed the design.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Those sharp corners, we rounded it off, like you see on the other screen, which is fine.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 Barely, we agreed that the color should be yellow and black.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow in the back, because it's more trendy than black anyway.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm okay, yeah.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 We agreed that we would implement both LCD and speed recognition, but I'll get to that in a moment.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Because some changes in the financials have letters and implications anyway.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, like I said, we had no insight into finances, no prices, but we have them now.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_01
 And it's bad.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we are, uh, prototype presentation.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, first, you guys built the prototype, so you could present that.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 But, um, let's see, what we had to do.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 Now, you know, just go ahead and present the, we'll, we'll scrap it later because.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's more or less the same.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's basically what we agreed upon.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 Not just a little bit.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 Not much.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't change that much.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't expect any of it.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 You just colored it.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 Final design.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, into what we discussed, covered buttons, what we made of rubber, yellow color, black components, as you can see right over here.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'll let the menu.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'll let the menu.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show you a different type of color for the menu, a bit darker yellow, so that it really shows in this keypad.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 If you put them all black, it's not really that good of contrast.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, and I suppose the yellow is not printed on the, on the rubber.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's part of the rubber, I suppose.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's more durable anyway than printed onto.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to the integration store again.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have, it's a bit round shaped.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we had.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 We chose the buttons to be teletext, okay button, favorite channel, and the mute.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's basically what we chose there.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 This is just a description of what we see there.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty much it.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's my time to ruin everything.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, not ruin everything, but.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, sorry.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 Finances.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we have here.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_01
 What you drew.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 We have battery power.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_01
 We have advanced chips and the sensor, sample sensor for speak recognition anyway.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, which you see the, which is one of the most expensive parts.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, we have seen one curve in design, rubber design, and we had a special color, suppose yellow is a special color.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's just half a year for, you got push buttons and an LCD display.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 Gives us a total of 17 euros in production cost, which is higher than the 12 and a half that we are permitted to use.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 So, easy.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 What do we scrape?

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think the best solution that I came up with is just to take out the speech recognition.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'd say that too.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 Because the LCD has more support on customer side.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 There are 91% of the people or something like that, but 90% who favor an LCD display and only 60% that favor speech recognition.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's harder to have a extra function with the speed tempo, which you can't do with a normal remote control, which people already do.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, I took that out.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, I was still stuck with 13, so I had to take out the special color, I suppose.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 And, yeah, I didn't see anything else I could take out.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I should take out the push buttons, but we need those.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, generally what I came up with.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 In order to have production cost of 12 and a half euros, scraped speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the, if people want it.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, just, then we'll just do it in black.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 We'll just, delivered in black, it has all the function that it's supposed to have.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 And if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 You make it, or whatever you want.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 I tend to disagree with you on that, because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, can't we just basically extend it to 13?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's just see what we know we have to be under 12 and a half.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's not, there's no go, we go over 12 and a half.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but there's another problem.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 If you take another cover, for instance, black, then we also need another button frame, because black and black doesn't work, obviously.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think you, that's what you were assigned to do really to see how both those work together.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think, yeah, I think it's a good way to, to help people, to make, to keep product 22, just keep, just make new covers for it, like we agreed before.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 And everything that's left is the basic function that we want our product to have, because the expensive parts are in the advanced chip, but we need that for the LCD display.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Then again, we have the LCD display, which is also expensive, but let's go together.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, we could take out the curve.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, say, let's, we could take out the curve, indeed.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 We could take out the curve. Is that an option?

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:07:06	None
 For you?

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think the other is more important than really the curve, because if you just end up with an entirely black,

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's, it'd be just ruin it, but the fact that I took that decision or took this example, actually not really the decision, but the example is because we do offer the, the possibility of adding your own custom cover so you can change them into any color you want.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's just you deliver basic remote control with the possibility to change it into whatever you want.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 Give me the note also, change the material. We take plastic for the basic cover.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 You can take plastic, but I, that's something that's stuck into my mind is that something, something that really can't forward from the marketing research is that people like the, the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the, we can put that in, it really makes it, also makes it different from the existing remote control, and it's all plastic. So, which in, in term, rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 But what do you then suggest we lose? Because we have to lose two things and, I guess.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 I, like I said, I lost the speech recognition and I lost a special color, which would make this.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and that's enough. Black and gray. Yeah, that's, that's enough.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, black and gray is okay. I guess those are the basic colors.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 Which we can fabricate. I think those people want to pay for it.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, they want, why, why do we have to keep us on the 12th?

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 To ensure the profit. That's, that's the order. We're just, we're the project team and we got our orders from the, from, from the cost of our company, which say we don't want to spend more than 50 for this.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 But that's not, that's not our decision to take. We have a budget of 1250 per product.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 We need to stick to that.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 Stick to that. I don't think it's really bad either. I mean, if we, we have the, the backup of, or the backup design thing.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 I hope the people would like it. To have, I think they would do. I think they do like, we, we agreed upon that the, that the, the, the, the cover thing was a nice idea because you could have all sorts of designs.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, at the same time just manufacturing one product. One basic product, which you can turn into any, any taste you want.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's the best solution.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 To make those custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between, of within the boundaries of your, of your budget.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's what should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost. And that, that they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost that they know that.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't think, yeah.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps it doesn't mean anything to the customer. Like, like, we don't care that you have to.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 No, but perhaps I think, okay, the cover is such a nice idea. Let's, that, that then they allow us to make some more cost.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 We can, we can at least tell them we didn't get that.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 You don't know that.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's, it should either be a pack, maybe it should, this should be sold in, in this, in stores with, with a standard cover or something.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 No, I'm not talking about that customer, but the one that has given us the order to design this.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 We could at least make it like this, but like you said, and then tell them, okay, we had to drop this and death just that you know.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_03
 It isn't still an option, but not for this price.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's true.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 So actually, it's not that much of an increase, but yeah, we kind of contact them.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the order that we got. So that's what we got to go with.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 So it's either once final, just to get it, just to get it through final, it's either turned into plastic, drop the squishy feel, make it, make it more breakable, or turn it yellow.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 So it's, so we have to decide on.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say lose the curve.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 I said lose the curve.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's true. We could lose the curve.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I forgot that. Sorry.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 The curve.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_02
 So which curve is that? That's basically just this one.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Just the banana curve.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so we could still have the comfort.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, that would be a curve inside the thing, I guess.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 Now, would you then would just be a straight remote, just like, like that?

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Which would, yeah, turn it to something far more ordinary.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 We could make it yellow then, but-

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 You second that.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 You second that, you second, do we lose the curve?

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, that it would turn out to be a pretty straightforward remote control. Okay, yeah. It's not really-

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve, to separate from the rest of the remote control world, so to speak. So we keep the curve.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the only solution is either to use the- lose the yellow or lose the rubber.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm in favor of keeping the rubber because it has more advantages than the color yellow has.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 I would say, I would agree with you on the color because that's an extra option.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 An extra service we can deliver for a little bit more money.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, I guess people are willing to pay for that, so I think we can take that option just with the idea in the back of our head that you can customize your remote control.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that would still make it a nice product.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're fine on that, so it's too bad. We can make the whole super thing, but- Anyways, we're here.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Basically what we discussed.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 Just now.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way, but because everything cannot be for free.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time because that was really essential, because we spent entire stage designing a product of which we had no- idea what it would cost.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, just something- I think it's really nothing stuck with reality actually.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Me too. I felt that blind throughout the project.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Because in the beginning I had no list of- Yeah, I think it would have been.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then I had no list of available finances.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 At least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's see if it sells.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I suppose this sells because it's very extended, but- I hope it sells.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose it sells because it's good.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's got everything for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's going to cost anyway.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_04
 Let's evaluate the product of us, our design.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 I have some methods, requirements and scale-off.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 I will present some statements and we will decide together what, if it's true or false.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 Then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_04
 And I will make a new blank sheet.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 So, the buttons, the look and feel, I thought it was okay, but that forms the settings screen, audio and channel.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 They're stuck on the menu.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 We are not- For the menu.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think those are totally met because we really took them for the- They have the feel they want, they have the simplicity they want.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's very well met.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Either two or one maybe.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, it could either be a two or one.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_04
 So, one and a half.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 Which is not an option.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 Oh yeah, let's create our own option.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_04
 Look and feel it everywhere, it's true.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 So, and the next one.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 When it's lost, you can find it.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 Even for deaf people.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's perfect, but we did everything possible to get it back.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's stuck in your couch.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 You can't see the light.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can't hear it.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 We tried.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think that deserves a one.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay then.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 And the next one.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 How is that?

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have a manual.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's part of it.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_03
 It could be a little bit more difficult than a normal module.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 But then again, it's for young people.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and LCD tells a lot about-

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 And it's pretty straightforward. Navigation, not keys to navigate through the LCD manual.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 I think it won't be a big problem.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's a one or- One.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 I think what we did-

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 For the other phones, there was no issue on making manual actually. No, it really discusses.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it takes no.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 It really doesn't take time to learn.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we took it so easy.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 We have so little buttons, everything speaks for itself really.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think it's two or one.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 I guess maybe it's a two because the LCD is a little new.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 There are some options hidden under the menu button.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 And LCD, you have to see it.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, just make that a two.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit learning.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit same, but it tells you- Can you just see it in a good way?

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's perfect.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 The where it is, what it can do.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 If it's useful.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 What are we displaying on the LCD screen?

0:17:34	SPEAKER_04
 Just only the channels and-

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 In the menu, sir. Things like brightness and those kind of things we've put in the menu.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have no buttons for those.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 There are basically menu options indeed.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, in the LCD screen.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the LCD screen, the small screen.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 And for the channel selection.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was- I thought the people wanted previews on there.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure that even possible.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Because it requires quite a bit of bandwidth.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's possible really, but they didn't really define what should be used for.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe a TV guide or something.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think, for example, like TV guides, I think that's- Yeah.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 That you can transmit through it and everything.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 Just for extra information on your programs.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_04
 It must be clear.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 It also thinks like- It must be for menus.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Or how about preferences of your- A lot of configuring your remote control for your favorite channel.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 For people.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 How do you configure that?

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 So that could be done by the LCD display.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's good.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's down to one because we're not using it perfectly.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't give it- I don't think- if we're discussing now, we gave it enough thought though.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should just lower it.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's a three though.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 You could have used it more effectively.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, indeed.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 So everybody's agree with the free on it.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 We are using it, but it's not poorly used, but it's not efficiently used I think.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 We could have even lost the selection button and done everything via LCD selection.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 Now it's just extra.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 To illustrate it.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Extra features.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 Free.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Nah, it's not really only an extra menu.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 Seven.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 That's a- Can you talk to remote control?

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 Or we can say- Well, we can't talk anymore.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we scraped that.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 Or we could say neutral because we scratched the-

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's just to be a prick, but if you can talk to your remote control, it doesn't do anything. You can talk to it.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 Not with the speech recognition.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 All the trends and all the colors anymore.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 So-

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we did take everything in consideration, of course. Yeah.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think- I think it's okay.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 But the colors, we don't have special colors.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 No, we don't have the colors.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 But we took into consideration the fact that it's customizable to the fashion.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we don't have it.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 So-

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have it. We do have it.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's just sold as a package.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's not part of the basic product.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Changing covers is also trends.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I call trending.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the shape is trendy.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 The functions are trendy.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the colors that are not supporting the basic model.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah, it's just not affordable.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should go with it too then.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not perfect.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 Because we can't do it initially.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible that you have to pay extra for the possibility of having a different color.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, well.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_04
 The two, right?

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 The last one.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 That's all score.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 Overall.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's a three.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_04
 16.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 16.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 Two points.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 Two points.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Seven or something.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 Sixteen divided by six.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 Two, two, third.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 So we can say it's the product is.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's okay.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 But mostly it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah, that gives you a seven which ruins your average.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 Without that it would be like it would be under two.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I think even with this it's reasonable.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if we make it into a four as in neutral because we didn't implement it so we can't say that we.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 And it's really not well implemented.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 We come out on average of two one eight.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's two.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 Which is pretty good.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, two three.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 At least on the positive side.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, definitely have done better if we've had more resources.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think it's probably.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 I do admit that we did miss a little or didn't talk enough about the possibility of the LCD display.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 We could have used it more efficiently.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 We just didn't think of it that way.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we've scored a few.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 So like I said, changing channels, everything hidden in your LCD display.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 So you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think for this price, this is really a reasonable product.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think we did very well.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Even if you look at this, we did quite well.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_04
 With an LCD screen.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Just looking for improvements what you could have improved.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 If the people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pay more.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's a combination.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 I should get kids and just stick them in TV and say change the channel.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 But for this price, you cannot ask that.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's not affordable.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 You should lose the LCD screen probably.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think the LCD screen is more worth that speech recognition.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's also more attractive.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 How's that?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the final product without the speakers.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 What was the left of that?

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 Another one.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 We evaluate the products.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 We're not.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 General projects.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 For example, I thought we were pretty creative.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was pretty creative.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 It was never ever listed somewhere.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 Favorite channel?

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Anyways, leadership is up to you.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps I screwed up.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 For this speech recognition.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's not from the inside.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think we did pretty well as teamwork.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 It was hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 When I got the input for the financial results, initially I wanted to contact USA.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Look, you're doing the wrong thing.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 You're wasting your time now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 It would be better if there was more communication between the director.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we usually do.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 Either call or email someone.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 That was too bad.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 It was the same thing that I had in the beginning.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 It was using materials that I didn't have.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 It didn't have or didn't know what they cost or what.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 That was a little unclear.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think a smartboard was pretty cool.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 It was easier to share them.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 For actual design, I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 The response time is very bad.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's good to visualize everything, but I think the response time could be a lot better.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 There's also one problem with this I noticed.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 You have to finish a page.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 No, you don't have to.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_00
 No, you don't.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't check the finish button.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 I just did you just copy it or whatever.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 Only if you check the notes or press done, then it exports the word automatically.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's not necessary to check either one of those two.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but I made a few.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can just preview your page in the program.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but I made three pages.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 They were not finished.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 When the third one was finished, I wanted to download it.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Then it was not possible anymore.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 You have to close all the pages before going further.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, before starting a new page.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 So you cannot work on one page at the same time?

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's not possible.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 You have to finish it completely, then download it, then start a new one.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's not very handy.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 If you know that, then it's not possible.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I understand it more.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Any new ideas?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, more communication between those things.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 I noticed that communication is very important because if you get new information, it's essential for the other teammates to know that as soon as possible.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 Because you would avoid doing extra work because you were doing extra work now working on the speech recognition limitation, both on the technical and on the design side.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that could have been better, but I think it's more of a setting here that you can communicate than somewhere else.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it could possibly be a more real-time information base.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 So we can all see.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think so.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Which information is available for you?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure you got spammed as well.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 I get to spend like every two minutes.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 There was another email about master classes or something, which were totally useless actually.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 I thought I should probably look into them.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 They were all useless.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 I personally did not have that.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's probably your distribution.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 What I also did not really assume you had that as well is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then there was just extra information.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 After five minutes.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 There was a little delay in that.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't have any more information.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's just always the same here.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that's kind of an email change, but not for me.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 I had no extra information to go.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't do any research myself.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 I could have done a little extra work probably.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 But I was busy enough anyway.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Any ideas found?

0:28:20	SPEAKER_00
 Or is that probably?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 How much time do we have for this anyway?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_00
 I have no clue.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 If the project is evaluated and it was within budget, we should celebrate.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 Bring out the beer.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 Champagne.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_00
 One more about it.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure what we should still do.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see, but all your tasks are finished, right?

0:29:00	SPEAKER_03
 I have no more emails.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's being very silent now.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 I still have the total report to finish up.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think we took very little time now.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 We're in agreement.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 The design is okay.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 One thing we missed though.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_03
 We have a product name.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's better than a serial number.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 Sony TR-something.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 Think of a catchy name.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 Until the beef.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 Fruit name?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Banana remote.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's the front.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's not yellow.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 I was going for the RC Deluxe, but it's not a catchy name or anything.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's more?

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not something with numbers.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_03
 Numbers are so meaningless to the panel.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 Something with our company name.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 Anything with that?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 A real website which will help us out.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 Real reaction.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 The future RC.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 Step into the future of remote controlling your TV.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 Is that a name or a campaign?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 That's a catchy slogan.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Control your remote control.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 I go for future RC.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 The real reactor I don't find that bad at all?

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 Real reactor.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 It makes me think of different products in a remote control.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 Real reaction.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Stepping.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 I'm looking for things in the name.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 The triple R.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Triple R.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_04
 Do you mean it like this?

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 Real reaction.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Remote control.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 It should be longer because it's not a product name.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 Triple R.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 Triple R.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_04
 The triple R.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_04
 The triple R.

0:32:41	None
 The triple R.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 The triple R.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think I like it like this more.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Triple R or triple RC.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 I like it like this.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 The triple R.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 The triple R.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 The triple R.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 The triple R.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 The triple R.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 Triple R.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_02

0:35:19	None
 The triple R.

0:35:24	None
 The triple R.

0:35:39	None
 The double R.

0:35:43	None
 The triple R.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Could you guys draw me a picture of the file design to put on the cover of the report?

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try to do it all over again.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture of it.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Is it okay if I try?

0:36:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'll put it by need information.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 It has been saving something.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I can export as you push.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is it okay if I try not to put this, whatever I want.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 My document is the wrong one.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 Is it not that we're placing?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's not on the network of the rest.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 I wouldn't take that one now.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's pity.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 That means that we have to draw it again.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 Are you going to do that?

0:37:31	None
 Yes.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:37:41	None
 Okay.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's correct.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's exposed.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_04
 Can I see scores?

0:38:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, of course.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_04
 One, one, two, three.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_04
 Overall two.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 I see you later.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:35	None
 Okay.
