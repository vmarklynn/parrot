0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we'll try to zip through this since we're short on time.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome everybody.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_00
 Hope your sessions went well.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 So this is our functional design meeting.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to consider user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 I've been taking meetings on the minutes, and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to, you can find them in there.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get the ones up next time.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 They're not finished yet.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 So can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 Just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 in the list. Is that an order?

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, I decided on an order.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 No, any order is fine.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 How do I put this?

0:01:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just put the cable in.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yeah, sorry.

0:01:42	None
 Is that it?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Can you see?

0:01:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's all up.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 It takes a few seconds I think.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 You may need to.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Who's that?

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 Look.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a three-setting cycle, so press it a couple of times.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_02
 Hold down function and then press function.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:33	None
 And then F8.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Could you just plug it back into hers?

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_02
 In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, 100 people were tested in usability laboratory through just their habits.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 They're habits were observed and questionnaires were given out.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 The findings in some cases matched what we were talking about.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 They don't like the way they feel.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 They don't think they match their operating behavior.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_02
 And an example is what we were talking about, the buttons.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 They only use 10% of the buttons.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 And later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_02
 And I think we should design according to these buttons.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to lose and RSI.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what RSI means.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 The person that did the questionnaire, obviously did.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_02
 According to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 The most important buttons in those do with channel selection.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 They're used about 160 times per hour.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_02
 And people like to zap a lot, apparently.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the order, translation, teletext, volume and power.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 The other ones are the settings and they're used less than 0.8 to 0.5 times per hour.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 This means that I think we could have a button for all the settings.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_02
 And then just one and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 About the screen and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 And if we look at the market, people from 15 to 35 year olds, I don't really know how to describe this.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the number of people that are above 35 years old.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 Go from 35% to 8%.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 So people that are 65, for example, wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes more are those like teenagers and young professionals and most likely, but we should discuss this together.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 And that's what I have to say about the matter.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 Shall I? What do I do? Do I give this to someone else?

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just move right on.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do this.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so now I need to press F8. What is it?

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 A function of it.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 What's function?

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's the little blue.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's the function.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 That should be cool.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 This is my presentation about the technical functions design.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 I basically just tried to focus on what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 I thought about it myself and looked on the internet.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user-friendly and fashionable way.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 Keeping buttons together, close together, that are used in the same way or maybe making the same color, keeping the number of buttons to a minimum.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Can you, small enough, large enough, I'm not sure.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we would need to do some research about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 But basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 Does it have capacity to change the channels?

0:08:12	SPEAKER_03
 Do we need to have functions for cable or VCR and then is it findable and how do we want to do that?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can find something that is more fun to look at and use than either of those.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 I like the one on the right better just because it does have fewer buttons.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can sort of think about things like color and size shapes and that sort of thing to best fit the user.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_03
 That concludes my presentation.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 This is on the working design, which is one of the mechanical functions of the remote.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 The method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need two basic functions, which is the basic remote functions.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 User can input a channel or a volume setting and it would be output to the TV.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 Also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send a signal to the remote where it would be for flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 The components we need are an energy source to power through a node.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 Processor to take the information.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Something to transmit it to the TV.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 We also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 You need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate thing that we would have to sell with the remote and if you could stick it on the TV or stick it on the wall.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 This is an overview of how the remote works.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Power comes from the battery, it goes to the chip, and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb, which would probably be the easiest way to send to the TV.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 Then the location function would have a sender on the TV, which would output some sort of signal.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 We could use IR, but we probably want to use radio instead.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 That signal would go to a receiver, it would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 My personal preference is for how to build the remote would probably be a battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 A button pad, input, we can purchase a pre-made chip, which will handle all the processing stuff.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 IR transmitter to communicate to the TV, that is standard.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Most TVs have an IR receiver.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 It is a radio receiver to send out a location function and to receive it.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 That includes my presentation.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 Do you know about, I don't know, do you seem like you know about?

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was an engineer.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have, we'll discuss that in a minute, I just want to mention some new project requirements that came in.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 Teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that's off the list.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Also, our remote should be used only for television.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 No, extra internet, kind of fancy things, just throw out in the television.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 And also, we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, the phase is we put fashion in electronics, so let's be fashionable with the bullet, I guess.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 If we have something, I mean silver and gold or yellow are colors, so if we have like a kind of silver on like you saw.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 And yellow writing, so now watch that.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 Do, I guess we should, yeah, make some kind of brainstorming.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 Like in terms of how it looks or like what it does?

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 What, well, probably our target group and how it's going to appeal to our target group in, I don't know, the buttons and what it does.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 That sort of thing.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's our target group, then people, so do you want to go ahead and design this thing with the finder button?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think that seems to, yeah.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, yeah.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 So then our target age group would be the 19 to 35 range.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, teenagers and young professionals.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's the speech recognition.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, well, that's the screen.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking about that, but, I mean, speech recognition is really hard to program.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 And also, if the TV is on, it's making sound and the people on the TV are talking, you know, somebody says like one and the TV is going to switch itself to channel one.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like a silly.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how you would implement it.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 I just put the button.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you consider a budget, if you consider a budget to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little crazy.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, are we going to have just some kind of a, like, we'll have the buzzer on the, like, on the TV itself?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or someplace, but it's a TV already has power.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 You click the button.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to send out a signal.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I was thinking IR is line of sight.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, unless the remote is like, actually in front of the TV, it's not going to work.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 So probably like a radio signal.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, you'd need like a separate base for that or like something.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 It would have to be sold separately because if the sender is on the remote, then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, do you plug it in the TV?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, probably just take it on your TV.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 So it's now like a two part.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 So we get to design that too.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 Fashionable.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_00
 So do you think even though we're not talking about speech recognition, our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals?

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 Just, yeah.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 We should that thing be on the thing to put the, you're talking about the home for it.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to pan on the wall or shall we leave that for now?

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 We probably leave that.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I guess one takes care of the other.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 If you can, yeah, if you can call it, then it's.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Then it can live anywhere.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 So you have that button that so this is our light or shall we leave just have a radio.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, we just have a TV on the phone on the phone.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 Um, seems like a need to lie.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what the phone is.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 We only need to find your phone.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 You just have to call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_00
 And like if the phone's under the couch, you're right.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's the light.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Um, so I need the other buttons.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 So you have this.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, the two remotes that you had shown.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't remember who shown me.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you need to.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Um, there.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, one look like it was for VCR type thing and the other looked like just television.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're both sort of just like general.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_03
 They're both general.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 They're both general.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 That is something we have to decide is whether we want to have VCR capabilities.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone know VCRs are the same across international?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 They're not.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 They're not.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you need like a whole difference.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's not VCRs.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 But DVD probably is.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, other than that region including thing.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Um, but VCRs.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 And if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean, it's going to be DVD type.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's the technology these days.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, okay.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 I think still it shouldn't be that hard to type like just reduce the number of buttons, you know?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 You just have like one menu button that works like with, you know, where you can just kind of scroll through the options.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for sure we need the, I think we can just design the channels.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, power is just about.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it's not used that much.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 So it's usually that red.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's quite nice to keep it like.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 You know, I've seen some remotes that were you just hold one, like if you hold one down, it's a different color than the other buttons, but that turns it on.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 So you don't actually have a separate power button.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like that would be hard though.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, because unless you know.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Am I pecan confusing?

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 Just because I wouldn't, I would probably pick it up and just be like, uh, why is there no

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 audience? Besides you like to be able to go power.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 I have the power.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 So we definitely want a power button and numbers.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 Or even, um, I don't know if people like this, but if you want to reduce the number of buttons, instead of having like one to nine, have a sort of, that sort of like joystick flat.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Because people like seem, now the eye puts up.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 And I like this thing that there's no, no, you don't have one to.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's an interesting idea because it's cool.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's, it's funny.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 Like you've, like, I just, I don't have an iPod, but like, you know, I just like started messing around with one of my friends the other day and you just sort of, and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Like it's not that hard.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's just, and it's one thing.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 And it is.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 It is really, but do you need a screen then?

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have to have a screen then?

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, can't it tell the, like, can't you?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the number, you can have the number.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 The telly go.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 One, two, three, four, five.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 Once you scroll.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 So we have this like scrolling sort of button.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Is that like an on a mouse pad where you're kind of, yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's like, it's just like the same.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's like, analogy as a mouse pad.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Like that.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 And then you do that.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can have, if you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Like that and that and then it can just be plus and minus.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 So like it's like a little part of the circle that.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 Or yeah.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so it's just a region of the circle that you can.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 Click.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 We could even have four buttons.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 Like if that's the, if that's the mouse, you could have the volume.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 The channel changes.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 So volume could be like the top and the bottom.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 So do you need to.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 So it'll be.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you have to like be able to change the function of it to like.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean the function?

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, like, okay, cause so.

0:21:44	None
 I don't know.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 So when you scroll your thumb like around it, it'll like, let's say you're going, you're going to clockwise that.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 That means you're going to go up the channels and then scroll the other way and it'll go down.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 But then so if you want to switch to the, do you have to switch to a function where.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Like, so either in that mode or you're in the mode where like.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 It just has like the four, like, you know, this is channel that way.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's that way and volume is up and down.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it knows for some reason.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 It just, the iPod knows.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 It just knows.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 The iPod knows.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 If it works on an iPod, then it works.

0:22:18	None
 Yeah.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 So you just, you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for the volume, you have to press the middle.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I mean.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 So you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 Go up and then it's like holding.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like holding.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 But if you like that makes more sense because there's already ones with up and down here.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 That I've seen.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 And you, is there an extra, actual button or you actually, you're just using the mass to go up and down?

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what do you, for the, I can put you press and, right, if you're on the channel, let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again, the volume goes up and if you do that, it goes down.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 But if you want to keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I mean, if we are going to use this for channels, right, and you, wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Like you could just have, I don't know, you can then have it up and down.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Or you could actually.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with you.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 But the only thing is like, I've had, they're so expensive.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 Like it has to be.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_03
 Is that part of it?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what makes me expensive?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 They have so much memory, though.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the capability.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they can hold what?

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 Like 5,000.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'm thinking we could, if we have, so, I mean, but an iPad just has that circle thing.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 So that's really why they're expensive.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 But like, since it just has this circle thing, you could make it a kind of cool shape.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Like it could be a cool sort of, you know, because it could be circular.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Or something weird like that.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 It could just be simple instead of being a mess.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 Because the other thing I didn't tell you on my presentation is that people find it, find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's another thing they complained about.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 What are the buttons, whether?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 Volume.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's just said that.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, okay.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 This is just for TV.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's not for, or it is, does need to be compatible with.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 DVD is simple.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You just have play, pause.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 So how do you know, actually, our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant, oh, use only for television as a not for DVD or just not internet type thing.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll check that and update you on the next.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 So like if we have that, we'll hold off on that.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 But DVD players do usually have their own remote.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 So I know I'm not clear.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 I'm clear I don't have it all on one because you know, you turn it on, then you want to turn off the volume, and then you want to go to the menu.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_03
 So you'd have to have like, I think you would have to have like a function switch button, you know, somewhere.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 So like you're either on TV or on DVD or you're on VCR or you're like, so.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the DVD is only like four buttons.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I mean like to switch the, so like, to switch the function of the little circle disk, the touchpad.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 The circle only does channel is an applicable to DVD really because you don't want to.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it would be.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Volume is, and volume is actually controlled on the TV so you don't have to switch.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button?

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 So like you're, if you're on TV, like you can switch channels, but then if, if you're on DVD, then like the channel button, like the, the region of the disk that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or, you know, to different.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, do we need to think about that?

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 That like, yeah, let's think about it because we need to wrap up.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 So everyone's going to go finish their questionnaire.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 Then when we come back after lunch, we'll have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 So think about the things we've discussed and bring some ideas to our next meeting.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 See you soon.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 So I feel like I want to spaceship.

0:26:23	None
 We're done.
