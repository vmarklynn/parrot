0:00:00	None
 Okay.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome to this second meeting.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's now quarter after 12 and we're given 40 minutes for this meeting.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is a meeting on functional design.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_03
 And I want to welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 I did took minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_03
 I know each of you have a presentation and in thinking about the 40 minutes, I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 Each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little less for your presentations and a little discussion because I happen to have been told there was some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 Does everybody agree with this?

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_03
 And after the meeting, there'll be things to be done and as you can see, it says we get to get lunch and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Now, for the minutes of the first meeting.

0:01:46	None
 Good.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 That one.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see, it was this earlier today.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 Kate, Steph, Sarah and myself in our full capacities were present.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 I opened the meeting.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 The product was developed and reviewed and we talked about the financial end of it and some implications, the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons, bright colors and some of the influence of the Japanese and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting reports together for this meeting.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have any questions on those minutes?

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Are they complete?

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Did they discuss everything that we covered last time?

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 Kate?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 Did I miss something?

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 We talked about the individual roles that we tried as well.

0:02:52	None
 Yeah.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 We did and we did a little bit of thought team building of making the pictures but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 So as a group, I think they are accepting minutes.

0:03:13	None
 Okay.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_00
 Is that what we were supposed to say?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I did.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then we'll move to the three presentations.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:29	None
 Okay.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 We need to move this.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 Who wants to go first?

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 As far as it goes.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 Not really meant to touch these.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have any on this one.

0:03:55	None
 Excellent.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 She said we didn't need to screw it in.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's doing it.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_00
 There we are.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 One of the biggest issues I thought about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell 4 million of these remote controls.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think that this was an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the same realm as an accessible, useful electronic device as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and for having it.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 My main goal here is to re-envision remote control in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 Some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 That means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep and what ones to discard.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 If we devote some energy into this, I think the recent productions of real reaction, the IGO, everywhere power and the high definition DVD players, although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these, I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_00
 In fact, I think the high definition DVD players and all of this will come along and will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well-designed tool.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 Again, most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 50% of all these numbers, most important, is 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons and 80% of users.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 If we think about this, there are a lot of television, DVD, stereo, remote control users out there, 80% and spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 Can I ask for these figures to come up with this?

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 There was market research and there were 100 people from the room, so 80 out of 100 said they would spend more money.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_03
 Now, in between, as the project manager, they sent me an email from the powers that be.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 That teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important, but that they want this remote control to only be for TV with incorporating the corporate image, color and slogan.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can really focus on this remote and, again, bring the real reaction brandy in and get some positive marketing for other tools, even if we directly don't advertise for the I-Go everywhere.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 An interesting element was the, would you pay more for speech recognition question?

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 So these market research questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and specifically wanted to find out if you're not speech recognition.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, now the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology and lucky for us, have the cash to pay for it, the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities, 91% of them would pay more for speech recognition and a remote control.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 Very interesting, I leave this up to the group to decide if we want to use this in the designers, but 91% is a large enough target market to target it.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think, especially in terms of growth, I think this would be a very smart group to target, I mean, three quarters of the next age group, 25 to 35 are interested in with the technologies improving if we can get to the same.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 In real numbers, this is the 91% and the 76% translate to in excess of the 4 million or

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 8 million, yes. But would you pay more and it doesn't work and is it approachable and did I know that it was a very good question?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if speech recognition should be included, but I think it's an interesting, I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 I've got more research on how much more it would be and any existing examples and what reactions to that would be.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 And this, how well how well target growths would be, the typical price of these things,

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 that can best be a little, but if we're even two, to fill this thing, the total year is 50. Is that a little?

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think that's a little bit of a competition, sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very, very important because there was a question about to want an LCD screen that wasn't responded to, but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate, you know, so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen and it's attempting to manage this super entertainment system with something that looks like a small train.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 And I think, you know...

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 What are the easy little age groups you must be one of the small population?

0:11:08	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 You're exactly right there.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I think the key is to get the early adopters, people with familiar technology and they'll be...

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we're not looking at whether the earlier adopters on that screen, that's looking at age groups.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, and I'm making the leap that people who are familiar, younger people are more familiar with technology.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 Or comfortable.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay, you had the other power...

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think the most important thing is an attractive streamline remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist, power, channel volume, and everything else is...

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
...up to the designers.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 And this is also supported by the market research.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:04	None
 Thank you.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's my contribution.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll turn to the next presentation.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think she said we don't need to screw it in, just stick it in.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 And then press what?

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 FN and F8.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll be patient.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, here we go.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Ta-da.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, just do each one of those.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 There we are.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yay!

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 Right, technical functions design.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as your personal preferences and I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 So my method was to look at the existing amounts and what functions they have.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 And what we all need to discuss is whether we want those functions pretty much the same as what existing amounts have if we can build on this with the speech recognition.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 That's not something I thought about at all, but it's also something we can discuss.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 And I presume we can miss out functions related to a video or DVD remote control if this is only going to be, you know, satellite cable TV remote control.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 So these are two models of existing remote controls.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 The one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 It has fast forward, stop play, all related to movies.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 It also has, seems to have channel up and channel down, which is more of what you'd expect from either like a sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a nearly terrestrial one.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right, which has also a play, stop and pause, or a thing.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we need them at all.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think we just need channel selection, volume up, volume down, and I think an inter function where you can access, it's not like teletext but along the same line, to access things on the screen.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Not related to internet one that you mentioned because that would be far outside our budget and what we want this to do.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 And exceed the requirements to expecting others.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 Really exceed the requirements because the requirements really I just want to be able to change channels and functions, which is more a text on the screen thing than the actual buttons.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking something, some smooth, sleek little remote control where big user friendly buttons and a menu that you can access.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 But then I do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 Anything else you want to add?

0:16:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we could go back to the pictures of the, what I thought, the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 Or, but I may just hear what Kate has to say first.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 That's your word Kate has to say.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe afterwards we could do a whiteboard that you're the one on the right.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think the white, the one on the right is as well as less cluttered.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely less quiet.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, but still it's.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's there but it's assumed something else I was going to say.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 The style of these is terrifying.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 I really think we need to not only possibly the materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons, positioning of buttons, the actual shape of the handheld device, colors, ergonomics.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 Everything to do with this has to be revolutionized.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 So that's that for now.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, I want to bring us down to earth again.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 So, let's go back to what the basic function of remote control is.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's sending a message.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the basic components we've got to build in for our 12 heroes 50 are an energy source, the user interface, which will incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the button's use it presses, we turn into a message.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I would have hoped, I think that's my only slide actually, I would have hoped to do you a pretty powerpoint slide of my first cut design but unfortunately the technology defeated me so if you'll bear with me, I'll do it on the whiteboard.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, we want an energy source.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, we've got to think about what that might be.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 And then we have the user interface.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 On the main components in the RV.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 The chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message, which then transfers to some sending mechanism, which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our 12 heroes 50.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:21:39	None
 Okay.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 But those things, it's also we can get those components.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 The block, that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in of what's it look like, what do the buttons look like, what does it feel like, that's where the user interface is really coming into its own.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 The technical end is what's actually going to be in there.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 But also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the battery energy source or what if the chip for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Is there any, because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces like for DVDs, movies, whatever, does it have to have a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I may wrong here, but I've been thinking of those devices being a cheap, less produced device with a Microsoft phone, million of them.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's almost one in every 10th house or whatever it is.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 And I haven't thought of it as being a repair or anything.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 You just check it out.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 And that's why I'm a bit concerned.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea of speech recognition.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good idea.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not convinced we've been put it into this box for the price that we're going to need to hit.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements?

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because then...

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't that your job?

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, the chip composer marketing.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no, the chip composer sending.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't believe I know.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm hoping that my personal coach is going to give me some advice.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'll ask him.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 It does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced, which is pretty much the same as these existing models, just maybe...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 Inspired?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 A little bit more inspired.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 But basically just the same.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 But what suddenly came into my head is they always take two AA batteries, which is really not very efficient at all.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 It could be possible to have a rechargeable internal battery, like an MPC player does.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 You could just...

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Or a mobile phone or whatever.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 You could just plug into a parasauce with a couple of hours and then it would be charged for ages and ages and ages.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 And you don't have to worry about replacing AA batteries.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that has a...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 No, I don't.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Which is, if every time you're done using a remote, you put it on a charger, then it has a...

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 You'd never need the batteries.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it also has a place.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's not stuck down the back of the sofa.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 But then again, I don't know if this is within our christ-ringing.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's really good.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think that's a very interesting idea.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what is this cost.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'll do some research for the next meeting.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's better than 90 of that solar probably.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 And solar may not be so good when you're watching TV in the night.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it is just so...

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 It would have to store up the energy.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I guess.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 And then use it.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 Solar can do that.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 It might be looking quite heavy then.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 We are not pretty heavy and cost too much.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 But just a rechargeable internal battery would probably...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it might cost more at first to develop and to install.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 But for a long-term use, there'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky AA batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_02
 So you think you might make that a selling point if it was something that you probably could afford to develop?

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely, because I'm thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remote temperature that is supposed to be not really having a home or a nest.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a little dock.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 So if you can dock it, you know, you could argue that.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 And the dock could look very fancy.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_03
 That could be your inspiration.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you're decent.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Within our crisis.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 You're talking about another component.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a big one.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 Are we agreed as to what our target group is, though?

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty much so that we'd be looking for the younger end.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 But I think you may see the questions about are there enough for these people out there?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 Or are they making purchasing decisions?

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because I agree that there are people with, how can I put it more money than cents?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 You are the buyer.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 I usually put more money than brains.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well, I'll make a note of that.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_00
 Good comment.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 But what I was going to say was although they may be buying personal music devices, are they necessarily buying TV remote controls because they probably live in a household that has a TV or phone.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 That is low end of the range.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 It might be good to know.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Who is actually buying television.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 And are we in the region where people have money and television?

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've got a big heel to climb it.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we've got this way people who go on remote control because it paid you the telly that they should buy our product instead.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Or do we make sure that it goes through the manufacturer?

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's probably what would be a more efficient way of doing it.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 And some of our TV players incidentally have them because we have federal issues with them in the department.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 But more of them need to go through them.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not going to get any resolutions by the end of the day.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 Probably not.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 The other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Our functions we've so far decided I think that power channel volume make it attractive.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 It has to have an enter key and of course the number keys.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_03
 It has to have big user friendly buttons.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 And definitely we want to be inspired that the current.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 Styles are just playing awful.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 Is that agreeable to everyone?

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 Actually.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 The enter key.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 I have a chart here that I didn't include.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_03
 Throw some light on that.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, we're, you know, we are almost a half hour out of the 40 minutes.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to get close to finishing.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_00
 My only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 That was my.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 Enter power as a.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 So simultaneous key.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 Again.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 Is that okay with you?

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 I was.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 I was.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 I was.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you're pressing enter the thing that I already.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 And so maybe when you press power.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 Enter.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I was thinking maybe you to turn it off.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 You'd have to press power twice.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe power follows something like a channel.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, or something that has a turning dial where.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 Who's got an iPod then.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 I wish.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, that was the only comment about some of the decisions people made.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 What's most important.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely channel volume power.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 Things like screen settings and audio settings.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 I would generally.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you have a.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_01
 You know, a little flat with a little control panel on the actual box itself.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 I would say that they are definitely less relevant.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks for looking at that.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's easy to use is the other thing that we want to be able to do.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want to be smart.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, don't make it too hard for the granny.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 I just joined that set last week.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 First grandchild around.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 So are we agreed then of those things?

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 And let's go back to agenda.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 And hook me up.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 I thought it'd be fun.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 We probably won't go the first time.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 I'll probably be in the mess.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 It lost it off here.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 No, it was up there, but I couldn't see it down here.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 This time it should be both.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 You have to keep doing the FN and F8 to five minutes to finish.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you a lot for telling me.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 We're ready to close that will be completed questionnaire.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 Then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'll put some minutes of this meeting together.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Your individual assignments are for Kate to do the components for you, Steph, to do the user interface.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 And for you, the trend watching.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 And each of us will get help from our coach.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 We're agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's the end of this meeting.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_00
 And you mentioned I was just going to say could you really like the new project requirements?

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be for a TV.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_03
 The teletext is outdated.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 The internet is important.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's only to be for a TV and it must include the corporate image, color and slogan, which I think is more in the user range with Steph.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 So what actually are these?

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the yellow and black?

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't tell me.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just use it on my website.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:27	None
 Thank you.
