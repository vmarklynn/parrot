0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 headphones that aren't so uncomfortable. I think this should be off the record, but I think

0:00:10	SPEAKER_04
 that okay. We're not recording yet are we?

0:00:12	SPEAKER_08
 No, that was some recording. I don't think that designed to be over your years.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know. It just, it really hurts. It gives you a headache. Temples, features. Yeah.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_08
 I thought I definitely haven't figured it out.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I have to need a quarter of my contentment, you know, after

0:00:39	SPEAKER_07
 some of the things that Kevin Chiena has said. We know exactly how much you have left. What were we going to talk about again? We said data collection, which we're doing.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to do it. Do we go around the room and do names or anything?

0:01:02	SPEAKER_08
 I think that's going to do. Usually we've done that. Also, we've done digits as well, but I forgot to print it out. So, besides with this big group.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_08
 No, I'd be better with this big. Yeah, but it takes too much time.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_09
 All right. What?

0:01:13	SPEAKER_09
 You'll think maybe point together in funny direction.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_09
 Sort of it.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_09
 The elephant would consider what it was.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 Whoops.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_09
 Sort of it.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_09
 Would it?

0:01:22	SPEAKER_09
 Sort of thing.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_09
 Oh, this thing.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_05
 That's it.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise it just gets hard to read.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yeah, the element should be close to your mouth as possible.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_04
 All right. How's that working?

0:01:36	SPEAKER_09
 It's fine.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_07
 All right. So, what we had was that we were going to talk about data collection.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_07
 And you put up their data format and other tasks during data collection.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think the goal was, what can we do? How can you do the data collection differently to get?

0:01:57	SPEAKER_04
 What can you add to it to get some information that would be helpful for the user interface design?

0:02:04	SPEAKER_04
 Like especially for querying.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_04
 Especially for querying. So, getting people to do queries afterwards, getting people to do summaries afterwards.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_05
 One thing that came up in the morning was the, if he has, I remember Mr.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_05
 Andrew. So, he has these note-taking things that would sort of be a summary which he wouldn't have to solicit if he were able to.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the timestamp.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_04
 So, action item or reminder to send this to so and so blah, blah, blah.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, that wouldn't be a summary. That would just be, that would be related to the query side.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_08
 But if we had the cross paths, we could ask people, you know, if something comes up, write it down and market somehow.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_09
 Right. I mean, we, because you'd have several people with these paths, you could collect different things.

0:03:01	None
 Right.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_09
 Because I tend to take notes which is summaries and so.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the downside to that is that he sort of indicated that the quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_08
 Well, that's all right. I don't think there'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up pretty easily.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 And that other things people can write whatever they want.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's to some extent for his benefit.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_04
 So, is that, you know, if we just keep it simple, then maybe it's still useful.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_07
 I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were going to do at the front or reach to do who we were.

0:03:53	None
 The roll call.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 Right. I thought you did that on purpose.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_04
 But anyways, we didn't roll call.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_07
 No, no, no, no. I just, I might go elsewhere.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_07
 So, yeah, I'm Morgan and I'm on channel three.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_08
 And I'm Adam Janon on channel eight.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_05
 I'm Jane Edwards. I think on channel B.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_09
 I'm Dan Ellis.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 Eric on channel nine.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 Liz on channel one.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 Marie on channel zero.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Catherine on channel two.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_05
 Should we use pseudonyms?

0:04:22	SPEAKER_05
 Should we do it a second time with pseudonyms?

0:04:26	SPEAKER_07
 Rocky Rekun.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_08
 You want to hear your channels and the museums?

0:04:30	SPEAKER_09
 Uh, museums, tourists, tourists, next, next, next ones.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_09
 Barabist, PDM, right?

0:04:37	SPEAKER_09
 PZM, right?

0:04:38	SPEAKER_09
 PDA, right?

0:04:39	SPEAKER_09
 PDA left.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_08
 And eventually once this room gets a little more organized, the gym let will be mounted under the table.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_08
 And these guys will be permanently mounted somehow, you know, probably with double sided tape.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_08
 But so we won't have to go through that.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_05
 I have a question on protocol in these meetings, which is when you say, Jim, the person listening won't know what that is.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_05
 How do we get, is that important information?

0:05:06	SPEAKER_05
 No, the, Jim, I mean the box that contains it.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I mean, supposed to be broadened out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_07
 There's going to be lots of things that any group of people know each other have in common, that we will not know.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 Right. So there will be jargon that we, they'll be transcriptionaries.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_07
 Okay. I mean, we were originally going to do this with the illicit design.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_07
 And the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately 90% of what we heard would be jargon to us.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_07
 That's one of the reasons.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_07
 But yeah.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_07
 That's right.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_07
 We're on this, of course.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, so we were on the data collection.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_05
 And the summary issue.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, so actually there's kind of three issues.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 There's the cross pad issue.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_04
 Should we do it?

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 And if so, what do we have them do?

0:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have people write summaries?

0:05:57	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody or one person?

0:06:00	SPEAKER_04
 And then do we ask people for how they would query things?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 There's some problems in that.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 And then when do you actually ask them about that?

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that was one thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said earlier that maybe two weeks later, which is when you would want to query, you can say, wait, ask them that.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 But there's a problem with that in that if you're not, if you don't have an interactive system, it's going to be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 And for explore the data further.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_07
 There's another problem, which is we certainly do want to branch out beyond recording meetings about meeting recorder.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_07
 And once we get out beyond our little group, people's motivation factor reduces enormously.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_07
 And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do, we did another meeting here for another group.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_07
 And they were fine with it.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_07
 But if we'd said, okay, now all eight of you have to come up with a lesson.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I asked them to.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_08
 And none of them did.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_08
 So I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_08
 And no one ever did.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_08
 I didn't follow up either.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_08
 So track them down and say, please do it now.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_08
 But no one spontaneously provided anything.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_07
 I'm worried that even if you did push them into it, it might be semi-random.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_07
 I suppose to what you'd really want to know if you were going to use this thing.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_08
 I just don't know how else to generate the query something getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say that's important.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_08
 That might be a query.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_05
 Well, there is this other thing, which we too are looking to early, which is there are certain key words, like action item, things like that, which could be used in.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_09
 So.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and I think the structure around.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I also was thinking with reference to the note-taking, the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_05
 One of the third thing I want to say is the summaries afterwards.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_05
 I think they should be recorded instead of written, because I think that it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_04
 How about this idea that normally, at most meetings, somebody is delegated to be a note taker?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 I have a good point.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 And so why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes?

0:08:20	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that gives you a summary,

0:08:22	SPEAKER_08
 but it doesn't really, how do you generate queries from that?

0:08:24	SPEAKER_09
 Well, I mean, maybe a summary is one of the things we'd want from the app to the system, right?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_09
 And something actually.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_08
 Then James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks, and the problem with that is, I'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval, even if it's sort of full bore, what I'm going to do for my thesis, I'm going to do something.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_08
 I'm not going to do anything with summarization.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_08
 And so if someone wants to do that, that's fine, but it's not going to be me.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I think that we, I mean, the core thing is that once we get some of these issues nailed down, we need to do a bunch of recordings, and send them off to IBM, and get a bunch of transcriptions, even if they're slightly flawed or need some other, and then we'll have some data there.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_07
 And then we can start looking at thinking, what do we want to know about these things, and the very least.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 I actually want to say something about the note pad.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 So if you could sense just when people are writing, and you tell them not to doodle or try not to be using that for other purposes, and each person has a note pad.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 They just get it when they come in a room.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then you can just have a plot of, you know, who's writing when?

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's all you, and you can also have notes of the meeting.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 But I bet that's, that will allow you to go into the, sort of the hot places where people write things down.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you can tell when you're in a meeting,

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 when everyone stops and writes something down, that something was just said, it may not be kept in the later summary, but at that point in time, it was something that was important.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 That wouldn't take any extra.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 Absolutely.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 Or someone could just, you could just put your hand on the pad and collect that if you want to.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_07
 That's a good idea, but maybe I'm missing something.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_07
 That doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries, right?

0:10:00	SPEAKER_07
 Well, what it does,

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 you can go to the points where you can actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 And you, yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what it does is provide a different, I think it's an interesting thing.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think it gets at the queries per se, but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that you want to say, what were the hot points of the meeting?

0:10:24	SPEAKER_07
 That's what I mean is that I think it gets us something interesting.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_07
 But if we were asking a question, which I thought we were of, of how do we figure out what's the nature of the queries that people are going to want to ask of such a system, knowing what's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 But I bet it's a good superset of it.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think you could say they're going to ask about when did so-and-so talk about blah, and at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 These are the questions where there are maybe keywords.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_08
 This would tell you what the hit is, not what the query is.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_08
 Right, right.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 It'll tell you the hit, but I think we're in a query for a moment.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit dangerous right now.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 We don't even know what, I mean, if you want to find out what an user will use, that might be true for one domain and one user, but I mean a different domain and a different user.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, but we're just looking for a place to start with that, because what James is going to be doing is looking at the user interface and he's looking at the query.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_07
 We have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff, but we have zero hours of queries.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_07
 So he's just sort of going where do I start?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you could do, I think the summaries actually may help get us there for a couple reasons.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 One, if you have a bunch of summaries, you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 So action item is going to come up, whether it's a VLSI meeting or speech meeting or whatever.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 So words that come up in different types of meetings, maybe something that you would want to query about.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_04
 The second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying, here's a summary of a meeting, what questions might you want to ask about it to go back?

0:12:16	SPEAKER_08
 I think that's difficult because then they're not going to ask the questions that are in the summary.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think it would give...

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 That's one possible scenario, though, is you have the summary and you want to ask questions to get more detail.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I think it has to be a participant.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it doesn't have to be.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_08
 Okay, so that is another use of meeting recorder that we haven't really talked about, which is for someone else, as opposed to as a remembrance agent, which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it, with the...

0:12:48	SPEAKER_08
 But I guess if you had a meeting participant, they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_08
 But it's not...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_08
 I don't know how to do it until you have a system.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_03
 The summary is actually going to drive the queries, then.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you're just going to be very circular.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_09
 But there is this class of queries, which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time, that some in retrospect, you think, well, Hang on, didn't we talk about that?

0:13:15	SPEAKER_09
 And it's not like the dinner trend summary, but that's kind of what this complete data capture is kind of nice as for.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_09
 Because the thing is that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record that they get recorded.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_09
 So I mean, and there's no way generally it knows until we just play at Shiaqa.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 So you could always post-talk, label them.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_09
 Right, right, exactly.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_09
 But I mean, it's difficult to sort of say.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_09
 And if I was going to ask four questions about this, what would they be?

0:13:38	SPEAKER_09
 Those are the kind of things that come up.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_08
 But at least then we'd get us started.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_09
 Oh, yeah.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_05
 I have something that if you can use the summaries as an indication of the important points of the meeting, then you might get something like, so if the obscure item you want to know more about was the sum form of data collection, you know, maybe the summary would say, you know, we discuss types of data collection.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_05
 And, you know, and maybe you could get to it by that.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_05
 If you have the larger structure of the discourse, then if you can categorize what it is that you're looking for with reference to those larger headaches, then you can find that even if you don't have direct root to that.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_08
 Although it seems like that's a high burden on the note-taker.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_08
 That's a pretty fine grain that the note-taker will have to take.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe Landay can put a student into the note-taker.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think you've got to have somebody who knows the topic or, you know, whose job it is delegated to be the note-taker.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 Somebody who's putting it in the...

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 No, I mean, but someone who can come sit in on the meetings and then takes the notes with them that the real note-taker.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 And that way that one student has, you know, a rough idea of what was going on, and they can use it for their research.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system, because that's a lot of trouble, and maybe it's not the best way to do it.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 But if he has some students that want to study that, then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings and get the notes from the note-taker.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I think that's a little bit of a problem.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_08
 They're sort of note-taking application stuff they've been doing for the last couple of years, and I don't think anyone is still working on it.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_08
 I think they're done.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_08
 So I'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_08
 So we'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_08
 And so the question is, is there such a person, I think right now, the answer is no.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_07
 I've been thinking about a little bit here about this.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_07
 I think that the, now I'm thinking that the summary is actually a reasonable bootstrap into what we'd like to get at.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_07
 It's not ideal, but we have to get started someplace.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_07
 So I was just thinking about, suppose we wanted to get, we have this collection of meaning.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_07
 We have five hours of stuff.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_07
 We get that transcribes.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_07
 Now we have five hours of meetings, and you ask me, what kind of questions do you want to ask?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_07
 I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_07
 I'd have to get started someplace.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_07
 So in fact, if I looked at a summary of it, I'd go, oh yeah, I was in that meeting.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_07
 I remember that.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_07
 What was the part that, and I think that might then help me to think of things, even things that aren't listed in the summary, but just as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 I think it serves two purposes.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_04
 One, as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 But also, I mean, maybe we do want to generate summaries.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, that's true.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then it's, you know, it's kind of a key.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 So how does the summary get generated?

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not a good idea of a summary, but I want to, to think carefully, suppose generating it, and how, because the summary will drive the queries.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_04
 What I think, you know, in most meetings, this one being different, but in most meetings that I attend, there's somebody explicitly taking notes frequently on a laptop.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 You can just make it be on a laptop.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 So then you're dealing with ASCII and not somebody.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 You don't have to go through handwriting recognition.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 And then they post-edited into a summary, and they email it out for a minute.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that happens in most meetings.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_05
 I think that we're using summary in two different ways.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_05
 So what you just described, I would describe as minutes.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_05
 What I originally thought was, if you ask someone, what was the meeting about?

0:17:30	SPEAKER_05
 And then they would say, what we talked about this, and then we talked about that, and so on and so on, we talked about it.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_05
 And then you'd have like, my thought was to have multiple people summarize it on recording rather than writing, because writing takes time, and you get a relevant other thing to take time.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_05
 Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting, about two minutes summary of what the meeting was about, I think you get, see, I also worry about having a single note anchor, because that's just one person's perception.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_05
 And it's relevant to what your focus was on that meeting.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_05
 And people have different major topics that they're interested in.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_05
 So my proposal would be that you may be worth considering both of those types.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_05
 Okay. Taking an spontaneous oral summary afterwards no longer than two minutes.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_07
 Adam, you can correct me on this, but my impression was that pretty much true that the meeting's here, nobody sits with a laptop.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_08
 And never seen it at the big scene.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_08
 Does anyone, I mean, Dan is the one who most frequently take notes.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_09
 And when we have other meetings, when I have meetings in the European projects, we have someone take that.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_09
 And we're like, yeah, but those are bigger, deal things, right?

0:18:42	SPEAKER_07
 Where you've got 15 people.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, most, this is one of the larger meetings.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_07
 Most of the meetings we have here are four or five people.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_07
 And you're not, you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_07
 You just get together and talk about what you're doing.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 I think it depends on whether it's a business meeting or a technical discussion.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 And I agree technical discussions.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 You don't usually have somebody taking notes.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_08
 But I ran a meeting.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_08
 I think notes that read.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_08
 Do they?

0:19:04	SPEAKER_08
 A person with a laptop.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_09
 Do you mean the only people that has any tips?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_08
 They're more, I mean, they're 10-ish.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 You should also have a record of what's on the board.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I find it very hard to reconstruct what's going on.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 And this is something early in the project we talked a lot about.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how, but for instance, I mean, the outline is sort of up here.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 And that's what people are seeing.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 And if you have a, or you could tell people not to use the board, but there's sort of this missing information.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_08
 We should, but you just, you could end up with video.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_08
 Well, and instrumented rooms.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_08
 And that's a different project, I think.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_09
 I think for this data capture, it would be nice to have a digital camera.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_09
 Just to take pictures of who's there, where the microphones are, and then we go, so if I didn't want to go, you'd have like three or four snaps.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 I agree.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's one of the things that we don't think that's...

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it will have a very hard time understanding.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 Don't you think that's the...

0:19:55	SPEAKER_09
 Well, no, I mean, I think, I mean, I think, I mean, I think the right now, we don't make a record of whether people are sitting on the tables.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_09
 And at some point, that might be off the use.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_08
 But I think adding...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, photographs, at a whole other level of progress.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_08
 It's just a digital record.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_09
 Not as part of the data you have to recover.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just in terms of...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_09
 Like archiving.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, I agree.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_05
 I agree.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_05
 Because it's close enough about things, and then you have the things that are not later

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 might be able to take these and say, okay, they, you know, at least these are the people who are there.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 And here's sort of what they started talking about.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_05
 And it's so simple, like, you said, three snapshots.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_05
 And...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_07
 Lizzy...

0:20:32	SPEAKER_07
 You said in on the subcommittee meeting or whatever, on the subcommittee meeting for at the workshop we were at that Mark Leverman was having.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_07
 So I wasn't there.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_07
 They must have had some discussion about video and visual aspect, and all that.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 Big, big interest.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Huge, I mean, it personally, I don't, I would never want to deal with it.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 I'm saying, first of all, there's a whole bunch of fusion issues that Dyerf was interested in, you know, fusing gesture and face recognition even live movement and things like that for this kind of task.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 And there's also, I think, a personal interest on a part of Mark Leverman in this kind of, in storing these images in any data we collect for that later, we can do it, I think, with it.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_07
 So to address what Adam's saying, I mean, I think that the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they're talking about doing.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_07
 And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it, right?

0:21:42	SPEAKER_07
 So.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_08
 But then it's going to be a lot of effort on our part to create it and store it and.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_07
 Right, so we're going to.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_08
 Standards and to do anything with it.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_07
 So we're going to do what we're going to do, whatever is reasonable for us.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_07
 But having.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Very crude, like I know with Atis, we just had a tape recorder running all the time.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 And later on, it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening, even though you just got the speech from the machine.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 So if you can find some really low, perplexity, yeah, way of doing that, I think it would be worthwhile.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_05
 I agree.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_05
 If it's simple, I mean, it's simple as to just the digital.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_07
 It's the digital.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_07
 Well, minimally, I mean, what Dan is referring to is, at least having some representation of the spatial position of the people, because we are interested in some spatial processing.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_07
 So.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_08
 Now what's the room a little more fixed?

0:22:32	SPEAKER_08
 That's a little easier to do.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_08
 Well, the wireless.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Also, CMU has been doing this.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 They were the most vocal at this meeting, Alex Weibelskrup.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 And they have said, I talked to the student who had done this, that with two fairly inexpensive cameras, they just recorded all the time, and were able to get all the information from, or maybe it was three, from all the pets.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some kind of processing on it if we don't.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_08
 I don't disagree.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_08
 I think that if you have that, then people who are interested in vision can use this database.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_08
 The problem with it is you have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_08
 So that there's going to be another group of people who are going to say, I won't participate.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 Or you could put a paper bag over everybody's head and not look at each other and not look at boards, and just I'll be sitting talking that would be an interesting video.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_05
 But I think we're just proposing a minimal preservation.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 I definitely won't participate as a camera.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 It's a spatial organization, and you can

0:23:39	SPEAKER_05
 anonymize the faces for that matter.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_08
 This is a lot of infrastructure and work.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's just set it up as long as anonymizing the movie. Not for CMU.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 They have a pretty crude setup.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 And they had, they just turned on these cameras.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 They were not moving or anything.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 Couldn't find it.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 And stored it on analog media.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 They didn't actually align it or anything.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 They have it though.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's worth considering.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe you want to sit in that much more time.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Did they start digitally?

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think they just had the videotapes with a counter or something.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I think for me, for our purposes, we probably might try that some.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_07
 And we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_07
 Which we'll get other value out of, I think.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_05
 The thing is, if it's easy to collect, then I think it's a wise thing to do because once it's gone, it's gone.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 And just the community, if LDC collects this data, I mean, if Mark Liverman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect, there will probably be some video data in there.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 And so that could argue for us.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_03
 Not doing it, or it could argue for us doing it.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 The only place where it's available relapses when some of the summarization issues actually could be easier, maybe easier if you had the video.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_07
 I think at the moment, we should be determining this on the basis of our own interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_07
 As you say, if they decide it's really critical, then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_07
 And we'll include all that.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_07
 I'm not worried about the cost of setting it up.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_07
 I'm worried about the cost of people looking at it.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_07
 In other words, it'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_07
 And so I think that we do have to do some picking choosing of the stuff that we're doing.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_07
 But I do think that we minimally want something that we might want to look at some subsets of that.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_07
 For a meeting like this, at least take a polar ride of the board.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or at least make sure that the note taker takes a snapshot of the board.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 And know the position of the people.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 That'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, otherwise, later on, if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down, we have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on that.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 I suppose this is comp-knowledge.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, this is shared knowledge among all the participants.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 And it's a shame to keep it off the recording.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_08
 If we weren't recording this, this would get lost, right?

0:26:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_05
 I don't understand that point.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_05
 I just think that the point is that we're not saving it

0:26:19	SPEAKER_08
 anyway, right, in our real life setting.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 What do you mean we're not saving it anyway? I've written all of this down and it's getting easier until you're able to.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_08
 Well, in that case, we don't need to take pictures of it.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 That would be the other option.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 I'm trying to make sure that anything that was on the board.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's where I'm saying that I think the note-taking would be, I think, for many meetings, there will be some sort of note-taking, in which case, that's a useful thing to have.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, we don't need to require it.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_04
 So we won't worry about requiring these things, but the more things that we can get it for, the more useful it will be for various applications.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_07
 So I mean, departing from the moment from the data collection question, but actually talking about this group and what we actually want to do.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_07
 So I guess that's the way you were figuring on doing was putting together some notes and sending them to everybody from today.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_07
 OK.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_07
 So the question that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during the collection.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_07
 I guess the cross pads were certainly one idea, and we'll get them from him.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_07
 We'll just do that.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_07
 And then the next thing we talked about was the summaries.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_07
 And are we going to do anything about that?

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 Well, before we leave the cross pads and call it done, so if I'm collecting data, then there is this question of do I use cross pads.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use cross pads, it's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it, unless you think that the cross pads are going to.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure what they're going to do, but having a small percentage of the data with it, I'm not sure whether that's useful or not.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's something to do.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we just do it and see what happens.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_07
 I guess the point was to try again to try to collect more information that could be useful later for the UI stuff.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_07
 So it's sort of landy supplying it so that landy stuff can be easier to do.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_07
 So right now, he's operating from zero.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_07
 And so even if we didn't get it done from UW, it seems like that could still at least try it.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be useful to have a small amount of it just as a proof of concept.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_08
 And he's not able to give enough of them away so we could probably get more as well.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 So if it seems to be really useful to you guys, we could probably get a donation to me.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_08
 I think it will again depend on landy.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_08
 And if he has a student who's interested in how much infrastructure we'll need, I mean, if it's easy, we can just do it.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_08
 But if it requires a lot of our time, we probably won't do it.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_07
 It's a lot of the stuff we're doing now really is pilot.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_07
 And once that's in other instance, we try it out.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_07
 We're going to see how it works.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_08
 I agree with that.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_08
 I think the important smarting is a good idea, though, that if people want something in front of them.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 That shouldn't be hard for them.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_08
 Doing pilots or laptops or something.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 OK, if something's important, everyone clap.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 OK, so cross paths, we're just going to try it and see what happens.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's right.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 OK, note taking.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that this is going to be useful.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 So if we record data, I will definitely ask for it.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we should just say, we don't want to put any extra burden on people.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 But if they happen to generate minutes, could they send it to us?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then what it's going to say is that I don't want

0:30:16	SPEAKER_08
 to ask people to do something. They wouldn't normally do it in a meeting.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_08
 So I just want to keep doing it.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_08
 I'm just going to keep doing it.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_08
 I think definitely the thing is this.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_08
 And then James idea of summarization afterward, I think is not bad picking out, basically, to let you pick out keywords and construct queries.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_08
 So who does this?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, thank you.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_08
 People in the meeting.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, just at the end of the meeting before you go.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_08
 Without worrying each other.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 Or even just one or two people stay behind.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_09
 People with radiant mics can go and separate rooms.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_09
 We continue recording.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_09
 But that is just nice thing.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 Then you should try them a few weeks later.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 And they have all these memory experiments about how we're going to actually retain it.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_09
 That's the thing.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_09
 We collect four different summaries.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_09
 You know, we're going to get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_09
 It's like, this is not what we meant to reset.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_09
 OK.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_09
 That's right.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_04
 But again, like the cross paths, I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think I know when I see the clock coming near the end of the meeting, I'm like inching towards the door.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_04
 So you're probably not going to get a lot of people wanting to do this.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_08
 I think maybe.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_08
 Is email easier?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, when you first said, do it spoken.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_08
 What I was thinking is, oh, then, you want to come up and you want to hook them up to the recorder.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_08
 So if they're already here, I think that's good.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_08
 But if they're not already here, I'd rather do email.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I just have to go over the least intrusive and quickest way is, and then closest to the meeting time to it, because people start to forget it is insane.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_04
 Because they're kind of a captive audience once they leave.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 Forget it.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 But it's.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 We did digits do the summary.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't think that they'll necessarily, you'll get many people willing to stay.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 But if you get even one.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I think it's like the note-taking thing that you can't sort of be a provider or you don't even want to do this.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_07
 But if there's some cases where they will, then it would be helpful.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 And I'm also wondering, couldn't that be included in the data sample so that you could increase the number of the boards that are recognized by a particular individual?

0:32:36	SPEAKER_05
 If you could include the person's meeting step and also the person's summary step, maybe that would be.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_09
 It's kind of nice.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_05
 Under the same acoustic circumstance, because they just want things to grow in their setup.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_05
 Nothing's changed.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 So I have a question about queries.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to make.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_08
 Which is, can we turn that light off?

0:33:02	SPEAKER_08
 Can we turn that just?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_07
 The fluorescent light is flickering, yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, it is.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_05
 There it is.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 How much was it?

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 For a little while, I thought it was just that I was really tired.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_04
 Too much caffeine.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 Too much caffeine.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 It really tired.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 No, maybe that's real.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was the projector for a moment.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 The question I had about queries was, so what we're planning to do is have people look at the sum raise and then generate queries?

0:33:25	SPEAKER_08
 Or are we going to try to generate queries?

0:33:28	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 And that was one suggestion.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 So the question I had is, we've given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I think there's a little research topic onto itself so that it may not be a feasible thing.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 So did a land day in his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this?

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is an issue that goes a little bit beyond where we are right now.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 Very, very expert.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah?

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little too wide to be picked up.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 What's our schedule?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you still want to talk to the students.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 If you and I need to just, no, we did the list talk.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, well, we already did this talk.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 So that was the positive thing.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_04
 We need to finish.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's already 415.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_04
 After, we need to finish this discussion.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 And you and I need a little time for wrap up in quad chart.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_06
 I'm going to do the disposal.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_04
 What's the plan for this discussion?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_07
 We should.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_07
 I think we should be able to wind up another half hour or something at least.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's much left.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_07
 So I think we still haven't talked about the action items.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 Action.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 So why don't you say 530?

0:34:48	SPEAKER_09
 530.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_04
 Is that OK?

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 We'll probably hit horrible traffic.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_09
 OK.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_09
 Thanks.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_09
 Bye.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 That's a lot of time.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_08
 But.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_08
 Well, in that said to, is it land-based problem?

0:35:02	SPEAKER_08
 He doesn't have a student who's interested right now in doing anything.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_08
 So he has very little manpower.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_08
 There's very little allocated for him.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 And also, he's pretty focused on user interface.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_08
 So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval, query generation.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_08
 That sort of stuff.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, well, there's going to be these student projects.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_07
 It can do some things, but it can't be yet.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_07
 Very deep.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_07
 I actually think that, again, just as a bootstrap, if we do have something like summaries, and having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves who are cooperative and willing to do yet more, come up with queries, could at least give land an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_07
 Right, if he doesn't know anything about the area and the people we're talking about.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 But the people will just look at the summaries.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_03
 They're the minute.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 And sort of back generate the queries that I'm worried about.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_03
 So you might as well just give him the summaries.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm not sure that's a solve problem.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_00
 How did generate queries from?

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 I'm from the summaries.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 That was sort of what might.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_03
 So what he wants to do is people who are there who later see a minute since put in summary form, which is not going to be at the same time as the meeting, there's no way that it can happen.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right, right.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 Are going to later go over and make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer or deeper.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 Or just memory.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's done.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_03
 I remember you were writing.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_03
 They have to do that offline.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_05
 I agree.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 I'm also wondering if we could ask people a question, which would be, what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting?

0:36:36	SPEAKER_05
 Because in terms of like informantiness, it might be that the summary would not even include what the person thought was the most interesting.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_03
 Dan doesn't know what's actually happening.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 But actually, I would say that's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_05
 I think you get two different types of things.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_04
 You get two?

0:36:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_05
 So you get like the general structure of important points of what the meeting was about.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_05
 You're still here?

0:37:03	SPEAKER_05
 So you get the general structure of important points of what the meeting was about with the summary.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_05
 But what's the most interesting thing you can learn?

0:37:10	SPEAKER_05
 So the fact that I know that transcriber usually is sad is something that I thought was interesting.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_05
 And then Dan worked on that.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_05
 So I thought that was really, yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_05
 So I mean, you could get a pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't occur as major headaches, but it could be very informative.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_05
 I think it would be too cost intensive either.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_05
 It means like someone can do pretty easily on this further moment.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_02
 Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them?

0:37:44	SPEAKER_08
 If many are willing to do it.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_09
 Making the voluntary thing.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_08
 Because you get very different answers from everybody, right?

0:37:50	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's why it's so interesting.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_08
 Well, maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we've already done.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_08
 We take minutes and we don't have summaries.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_08
 But people could like listen to them a little bit and generate some queries.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_08
 Of course, Jane doesn't need to.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_08
 I'm sure you have that meeting memorized right now.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_04
 But actually, it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned for those people willing to stay.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_05
 And I think we pick up the microstructure.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_05
 Some of them.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_04
 And that might be something people are willing to stay for.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I don't know how I want to end it.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 If you could have them you could have them go around the room.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 You might just get the effect that somebody says something and then you could go around the room and they say, yeah, me too, I agree.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_09
 Well, I might try and call the different ones.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_09
 I might say, well, I was going to say, well, I'm going to fix something else.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_08
 You have the other thing that they know why we're doing it.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_08
 Well, we'll be telling them the reason we're trying to do this is to generate queries in the future.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_08
 So try to pick things that other people didn't say.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_07
 It's going to take some time.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, the kind of interest that I had in this thing initially was that basically the form that you're doing something else later.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_07
 And you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_07
 So it's really the what's important is in the something else.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_07
 And it might be something minor of minor importance to the meeting.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_07
 In fact, if it was really major, it was the thing that really stuck in your head, then you might not need to go back and check on it.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_07
 So it's that you're trying to find your, now, you weren't interested.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_07
 Say, I said, well, I wasn't that much interested in dialogue again, or it was a person.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_07
 But three months from now, some reason I get really interested in dialogue.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_06
 What is, what was that part of that?

0:39:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, Jim Bass says that.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_08
 A few lights on dialogue.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_07
 And then I'm trying to, I mean, that's when I look in general, when I look things up most, is when it's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_07
 But for some new reason, I'm interested in the old stuff.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_08
 But that's a very bad to generate.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's hard to generate.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that's half of what I would use it for.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_04
 But I also, a lot of times, think to myself, this is interesting.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_04
 I've got to come back and follow up on it.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_04
 So things that I think are interesting, I would be wanting to do a query about.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_04
 And also, I like the idea of going around the room, because if somebody else thought something was interesting, I'd kind of want to know about it.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then I'd want to follow up on it.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that might get it somewhat of what I was concerned about being interested in something later that I didn't consider to be important the first time, which for me is actually the dominant thing, because I thought it was really important that tends to stick more than if I didn't.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_07
 But some new task comes along, makes me want to know.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_08
 But what's interesting to me may not have been interesting.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, so having multiple people might get it some of that.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I think you can't get it all of it.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_08
 Right?

0:41:06	SPEAKER_08
 We just need to start somewhere.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is a starting point.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_00
 Question men is, how much bias do we introduce by saying, this was important now, and maybe that is something else is important later?

0:41:18	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, does the bias matter?

0:41:21	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I guess the question for you guys.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_05
 Well, and one thing, we were saying important, and we're saying interesting.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_05
 And I guess it was coming to a different thing.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_00
 Sure, sure.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_00
 But I guess that's the question, really, is that, I mean, does building queries based on what's important now introduce an irreversible bias on being able to do what more we want to do later?

0:41:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, irreversible.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I guess what I keep coming back to in my own mind is that the soonest we can do it, we need to get some kind of system so that people who've been involved in the meeting can go back later, even if it's poor system in some ways, and ask the questions that they actually want to know.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_07
 As soon as we can get that going at any kind of level, then I think we'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than anything we do before that.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_07
 But obviously, we have to put some somehow.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:42:20	None
 Right.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_05
 I will say that I chose interesting because I think it includes all some important in some cases.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_05
 But I feel like the summary gets a different time of information.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's important to often be uninteresting.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_00
 And I also think it's a large thing that it puts.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_05
 It puts a lot of burden on the person to evaluate.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_05
 I think interest is not threatening you.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_04
 In the interest of generating an interesting summary, in the interest of generating some in this here, and also moving on to action items and other things, let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important, that we at least decide on cross pads.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to try if Landa can get them to you guys.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_04
 And see if they're interesting, and if they are, then we'll try to do it more.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_04
 Getting electronic summary from a note-taking person, if they happen to do it anyway, getting just individual pictures, a couple of digital pictures of the table and boards to set the context of the meeting.

0:43:43	SPEAKER_04
 And then going around the room at the end to just say, ask people to mention something interesting that they learned.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_04
 So rather than say the most interesting thing, something interesting in that way, you'll get more variety.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_08
 I wouldn't even say that they learned.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:44:03	SPEAKER_08
 You might want to mention something that you brought up.

0:44:06	SPEAKER_04
 Being that was discussed.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_04
 And then the last thing would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary.

0:44:24	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:44:24	SPEAKER_04
 Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about?

0:44:28	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that we want to do.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_05
 I want to look at the patient on the oral summary.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_05
 They'd be separate.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_05
 They wouldn't be here.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_08
 That's what I think that's going to prognonately end up being whoever takes down the equipment.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_05
 And that would also be the thing we need to do.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_05
 We need to put in a database.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, there is still this hope that people might actually think of real queries that really want to ask at some point.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_09
 And if that episode happened, then we should try to write down.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_08
 Give them a dollar or a query.

0:44:57	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, really.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_07
 Real queries.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_07
 OK.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_07
 And again, if we can figure out a way to Jimmy, a very rough system, say, in a year.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_07
 Then so that in the second and third years, we actually have something to play with in generate real queries.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_04
 Asperger.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_04
 Asperger.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:45:14	SPEAKER_03
 So I think I just wanted to say one thing about queries.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the level of the query can be very low level, or very high level.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it gets fuzzy and fuzzy as you go.

0:45:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, right.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_03
 So you need to have some sort of, if you start working with queries, some way of identifying with it.

0:45:34	SPEAKER_03
 This is something that requires a one word answer, or it's one place in the recording versus, was there a general agreement on this issue of all the people who had, you can ask queries that are meaningful for people.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_03
 In fact, they're very meaningful, because they're very high level.

0:45:50	SPEAKER_03
 But they won't exist anywhere in the app.

0:45:52	SPEAKER_03
 Absolutely.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_08
 So I think we're going to have to start with keywords.

0:45:55	SPEAKER_08
 And if someone comes more interested, we could work our way up.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_08
 But it may well.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_07
 But it may well.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_07
 It may well.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_07
 Because it depends on what a goal is.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_07
 If our goal is wizard or wasdish, we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_07
 And if it's something that we don't know how to do yet, that's great.

0:46:11	SPEAKER_07
 That's research project.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_07
 Mm-hmm.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_07
 Or something.

0:46:15	SPEAKER_08
 I was thinking about wizard of laws, but it requires wizard of the know all about the media.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_07
 Well, maybe not true wizard of it.

0:46:25	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yes.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_07
 Because people are too.

0:46:27	SPEAKER_07
 Just imagining it.

0:46:28	SPEAKER_07
 Aware of what's going on.

0:46:29	SPEAKER_09
 But just get people to ask questions.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_09
 So they don't have the machine that they can't answer the mind.

0:46:34	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:46:34	SPEAKER_07
 But what would you like to do?

0:46:35	SPEAKER_08
 Neither could anyone else, though, is what my point is.

0:46:37	SPEAKER_08
 Yes.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_05
 I was wondering if there might be once more source of queries, which is indicator phrases, like action, I have.

0:46:43	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_05
 So you can take the text.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to transcript.

0:46:54	SPEAKER_08
 Dates, maybe, and I don't know.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_08
 That's something I always forget.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be determined.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well, probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember, it's probably whatever action item was assigned to you.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_03
 That's all I remember.

0:47:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's all I wrote down.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_03
 So in general, I mean, that could be something you could say, right?

0:47:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm supposed to do this.

0:47:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_05
 It does.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_05
 You could be profan just saying not of your action item.

0:47:19	SPEAKER_05
 But the action item would be a way to get maybe an additional query.

0:47:22	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's realistically what people might well be remembering.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll be not being able to do it.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we're piloting.

0:47:30	SPEAKER_04
 We'll just do it and see what happens.

0:47:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, I don't remember my action items.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:47:36	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_04
 Speaking of action items, can we move on to action items?

0:47:42	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:47:42	SPEAKER_04
 Are you hinting my?

0:47:44	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe we should wait until this meeting is transcribed.

0:47:49	SPEAKER_04
 And then we will bet.

0:47:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, somewhere up there, we had milestones.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_06
 But I guess did you get enough milestones?

0:47:55	SPEAKER_04
 I got the description.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them?

0:48:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_07
 And then, obviously, you can't hide each of those as much as this need.

0:48:09	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_04
 What I have down for action items is we're supposed to find out about our human subject requirements.

0:48:21	SPEAKER_04
 People are supposed to send me URLs for web pages.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_04
 They could not put together an overall cover.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_09
 And you're seeing.

0:48:31	SPEAKER_09
 We need to look at our web page and make a comment.

0:48:33	SPEAKER_04
 And you also need to look at your web page and clean it up by mid-July.

0:48:40	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:48:41	SPEAKER_04
 Do do do do.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_04
 Mailing lists.

0:48:43	SPEAKER_04
 Mailing list.

0:48:45	SPEAKER_04
 You need to put together a mailing list.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_04
 I need to email Adam or Jane about getting the data.

0:49:01	SPEAKER_04
 Who should I email?

0:49:02	SPEAKER_08
 How quickly do you want it?

0:49:04	SPEAKER_08
 My July is really very crowded.

0:49:07	SPEAKER_04
 And so how about if I just right now all I want, I personally only want text data.

0:49:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think the only thing Jeff would do anything with right now, but I'm just speaking based on a conversation with him two weeks ago in Turkey.

0:49:21	SPEAKER_04
 But I think all he would want is a digit.

0:49:25	SPEAKER_04
 But I'll just speak for myself.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_04
 I'm interested in getting the language model data.

0:49:29	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm just interested in getting transcriptions.

0:49:31	SPEAKER_04
 So then just email you.

0:49:32	SPEAKER_04
 Sure, sure, sure.

0:49:33	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:49:34	SPEAKER_05
 You could email the both of us.

0:49:35	SPEAKER_05
 Just if you want to, let me have a thing.

0:49:38	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:49:38	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to write a line of each.

0:49:40	SPEAKER_05
 And your email is at.

0:49:42	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks.

0:49:46	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_07
 In our phone call, before we turns out the way we're going to send the data is by CDROMs.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_07
 And then what they're going to do is take the CDROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_05
 That was a side table.

0:50:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:50:03	SPEAKER_07
 Using foot pedals.

0:50:04	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, foot pedals.

0:50:07	SPEAKER_08
 So how are they going to do the multi-chance?

0:50:10	SPEAKER_07
 See, that's a good question.

0:50:11	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, they need all the way.

0:50:13	SPEAKER_07
 No, I mean, it'll be about like you did.

0:50:16	SPEAKER_07
 And then there'll be some things, you know, many things that don't work out well.

0:50:20	SPEAKER_07
 And that would go back to IBM.

0:50:21	SPEAKER_07
 And they'll run their aligner on it.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_07
 And it kicks out things don't work well, which, you know, the overlaps will certainly the examples of that.

0:50:29	SPEAKER_07
 And I mean, we will give them all of it, right?

0:50:32	SPEAKER_07
 I'll give them all of them.

0:50:33	SPEAKER_08
 So we'll give them all 16 channels.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_08
 And they'll do whatever they want with it.

0:50:36	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:50:37	SPEAKER_03
 But you also should probably give them the mixed, you know, equal.

0:50:41	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:50:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, they're not going to easily be able to do that.

0:50:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's not hard.

0:50:46	SPEAKER_07
 It also won't be adding much to the data data.

0:50:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, right.

0:50:50	SPEAKER_00
 It is a difficult for us to do.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you should.

0:50:53	SPEAKER_03
 That may be all that they want to send off to their transcript.

0:50:57	SPEAKER_04
 OK, related to the conversation with Puccini, I need to email him my shipping address.

0:51:04	SPEAKER_04
 And you need to email them something which you already did.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, email them the trans cover URL, the online data that Adam set up, the URL so they can click on another instance here.

0:51:16	SPEAKER_05
 And I have emailed them the streamlined conventions, which you got a copy of today.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_07
 Now, I was going to email them a pointer to the web pages that we currently have, because particularly, they want to see the one with the way the recording room is set up.

0:51:30	SPEAKER_07
 So on here.

0:51:37	SPEAKER_05
 And it's possible.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_05
 I should have sent a message.

0:51:40	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:51:40	SPEAKER_08
 Not immediate action.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_08
 I have to put something I do have to worry about is data formats for higher level information.

0:51:47	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:51:50	SPEAKER_08
 Well, not even higher level, different level of processing and all that sort of stuff.

0:51:53	SPEAKER_08
 We're going to have to figure out how we're going to annotate that.

0:51:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we never had our data format discussion.

0:51:59	SPEAKER_05
 Why don't we do it?

0:52:00	SPEAKER_05
 We discussed these musicals for rotation.

0:52:03	SPEAKER_05
 So that's something that's displayed.

0:52:05	SPEAKER_08
 That's different than format.

0:52:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, my feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work and whatever you want.

0:52:13	SPEAKER_04
 We're happy to live with other people may not agree with that, because I'm not actually touching the data.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_04
 So I shouldn't be the one to talk.

0:52:21	SPEAKER_07
 But I think that's fine.

0:52:23	SPEAKER_07
 So key thing will be that we tell you.

0:52:25	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:52:26	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:52:27	SPEAKER_07
 But we also have the year speed that you're going to guess 800 number in the world.

0:52:35	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:52:36	SPEAKER_07
 You're going to call your communicator thing and we're going to be good slash bad, depending on your users.

0:52:44	SPEAKER_02
 Something that I mentioned earlier to Murray and Liz is that it's probably important to get as many non-technical and non-speech people as possible in order to get some realistic users.

0:52:54	SPEAKER_02
 So if you could ask other people to call and use our system that would be good, because we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems who know that you shouldn't type or articulate, for instance, and things like that.

0:53:07	SPEAKER_04
 So like if you have somebody who makes your plane reservations for you, which is your parents to do it.

0:53:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for instance.

0:53:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, seriously.

0:53:17	SPEAKER_04
 Your grandmother.

0:53:18	SPEAKER_04
 And you know, it could result in some good bloopers, which is always good for presentations.

0:53:26	SPEAKER_04
 So anyway.

0:53:30	SPEAKER_08
 Father would last through the second prompt pre-hang hung up.

0:53:34	SPEAKER_08
 I don't know where the memory is.

0:53:36	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know what that means.

0:53:39	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:53:41	SPEAKER_04
 Other, let's see, other action items.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_04
 So I have to.

0:53:46	SPEAKER_06
 I'm happy getting the recording equipment right in the W.

0:53:49	SPEAKER_06
 And so it depends.

0:53:52	SPEAKER_07
 There are if that comes together within the next month, there at least will be major communications between Dan

0:54:01	SPEAKER_04
 and W. I mean, I'm shooting to try to get it done, get it put together by the beginning of August.

0:54:08	SPEAKER_04
 So we have it.

0:54:11	SPEAKER_07
 It's pretty, we don't know.

0:54:12	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, he said that it was sitting in some room, collecting dust.

0:54:16	SPEAKER_07
 And so we don't know.

0:54:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably unlikely that we'll pull this off, but at least as we're trying.

0:54:23	SPEAKER_07
 What is it?

0:54:24	SPEAKER_07
 We don't know.

0:54:25	SPEAKER_07
 Recording equipment.

0:54:28	SPEAKER_07
 The paper recorder.

0:54:29	SPEAKER_07
 We know it's eight channels.

0:54:31	SPEAKER_07
 We know it's digital.

0:54:32	SPEAKER_07
 We don't even know if the microphones.

0:54:34	SPEAKER_07
 And so.

0:54:38	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:54:40	SPEAKER_04
 And I will email these notes.

0:54:45	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff, though.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_04
 Then I guess somebody needs to tell Andy that you want the pads.

0:54:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, OK.

0:54:54	SPEAKER_04
 I'll do that.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:54:58	SPEAKER_06
 And he also said something about outside the vacuum of the outside tech sources that he may have.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_06
 Oh.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_06
 Some tech sources that are close enough to the certain you can play with.

0:55:10	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, that was, that was, what he was saying was this.

0:55:13	SPEAKER_09
 The thing that Jason have been working on finds web pages that are dramatically related to what you're talking about, that's the idea.

0:55:20	SPEAKER_09
 So that would be a source of text, which is supposedly got the right vocabulary.

0:55:26	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:55:27	SPEAKER_09
 But there's always a great difference between materials, not spike materials.

0:55:30	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_09
 It might be.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_04
 But that's actually what I want to do.

0:55:33	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I want to work with.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_04
 This is being said, the wrong material, but the right source is the right.

0:55:41	SPEAKER_08
 Unfortunately, Andy told me that Jason is not going to be working on that anymore, switching to.

0:55:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:46	SPEAKER_04
 When I asked him if he could actually supply data, he seemed a little bit more reluctant.

0:55:51	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll send him email, put it in action on him that I sent him email about it.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_04
 And if I get something great, if I don't get something, the lander, Jason.

0:55:58	SPEAKER_04
 Lander.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_04
 And otherwise, if you guys have any papers, I could use your web pages.

0:56:08	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we can do.

0:56:10	SPEAKER_04
 You've got all the web pages on me.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_09
 So I search for them.

0:56:14	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, forget this.

0:56:16	SPEAKER_04
 One last action item.

0:56:19	SPEAKER_04
 I could use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders.

0:56:24	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, that's basically what his software does is it picks out keywords and does a Google-like search.

0:56:31	SPEAKER_07
 You could do better than that.

0:56:33	SPEAKER_07
 There's some kind of ginal and stuff, right?

0:56:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:56:37	SPEAKER_04
 So you should look under like zero.

0:56:40	SPEAKER_03
 You could do intelligent environments, smart rooms.

0:56:43	SPEAKER_08
 The Georgia Tech classroom 2000.

0:56:45	SPEAKER_03
 See, I mean, right.

0:56:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then, right, that's where I thought you would want to eventually be able to have a board or a camera.

0:56:51	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think the last one.

0:56:53	SPEAKER_08
 No, Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room.

0:56:56	SPEAKER_08
 And I want to try to stay away from that.

0:57:00	SPEAKER_04
 OK, great.

0:57:01	SPEAKER_04
 That solves that problem.

0:57:03	SPEAKER_04
 One last action item.

0:57:04	SPEAKER_04
 OK, I think that's pretty much all I can think of.

0:57:13	SPEAKER_04
 I can ask one thing.

0:57:14	SPEAKER_05
 It relates to data collection.

0:57:15	SPEAKER_05
 And we mentioned earlier today this question of, so I know that with the near field likes, some of the problems that come with overlapping speech are lessened.

0:57:28	SPEAKER_05
 But I wonder if is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that we could have a meeting with less overlap than what otherwise be the case.

0:57:43	SPEAKER_05
 So either by rules, participation, or whatever.

0:57:46	SPEAKER_05
 Now, I mean, it's true.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we were discussing this earlier that, depending on the task, so if you've got someone giving a report, you're not going to have as much overlap.

0:57:54	SPEAKER_05
 But so we're going to have non-overlapping samples anyway.

0:57:59	SPEAKER_05
 But in a meeting, which would otherwise be highly overlapping, is the near field like enough?

0:58:05	SPEAKER_05
 Or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap?

0:58:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think we should have rules of participation, but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings.

0:58:16	SPEAKER_04
 That's something that if we get the meeting stuff going at UW, that I probably can do more than you guys, because you guys are probably mostly going to get exceed people here.

0:58:28	SPEAKER_04
 But we can get anybody in EE over and possibly also some CS people over at UW.

0:58:38	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that there's a good chance that we could get more variety.

0:58:43	SPEAKER_03
 There's still an overlap.

0:58:45	SPEAKER_03
 But Mark and others have said that there's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic.

0:58:51	SPEAKER_03
 And also the political, anything that was televised for third party has the characteristic of not very much overlap.

0:59:00	SPEAKER_07
 But I think we're saying before I'll solve that the natural language group here had less overlap.

0:59:04	SPEAKER_07
 So it also depends on the style of the way

0:59:06	SPEAKER_03
 you talk about it. Dominance, relation, is the people is voting?

0:59:10	SPEAKER_05
 Because it is true.

0:59:11	SPEAKER_05
 People can modify the amount of overlap that they do if they're asked to, not entirely modify, but less than if it's desired.

0:59:21	SPEAKER_05
 But if that's sufficient data, I just want to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed.

0:59:33	SPEAKER_04
 OK, so I'm just writing here.

0:59:35	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to try to specify rules of interaction, but we're going to try to get more variety by using different groups of people and different sizes.

0:59:50	SPEAKER_05
 And I know that you're a new bicycle to take care of also the problems of the history.

0:59:55	SPEAKER_04
 And then the other thing might be technical versus administrative.

1:00:06	SPEAKER_04
 Because if I recorded some administrative meetings, then that may have less overlap.

1:00:11	SPEAKER_04
 Because you might have more overlap when you're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever.

1:00:16	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I just as a contributor, so I know that in legal depositions, people are prevented from overlapping, just saying, wait till each person is finished before you say something.

1:00:28	SPEAKER_05
 So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to.

1:00:30	SPEAKER_05
 But these other factors are fine.

1:00:32	SPEAKER_05
 I just wanted to reason.

1:00:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the reason why I didn't want to is, why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as unintrusive as possible.

1:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 You could be with these things hanging on you.

1:00:46	SPEAKER_05
 I think that's always the sort of, I just want to be sure that we're able to process as much data as we can.

1:00:53	SPEAKER_07
 Do they discuss any of that in the meeting they had with Lieberman?

1:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 What did they do?

1:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 There was a big division.

1:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 So Lieberman and others were interested in a lot of found data.

1:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 So there's lots of recordings that they're not close to off mic.

1:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 And there's lots of television stuff.

1:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm political debates, things like that.

1:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 Congressional hearings, boring stuff like that.

1:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side.

1:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 And because they had collected a lot of meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings.

1:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 So they're really two different kinds of data.

1:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we just left it as that if there's found data that can be transformed for use and speech recognition easily, then of course we would do it.

1:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 But newly collected data would be natural meetings.

1:01:44	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, the CMU folks have collected a lot of data.

1:01:47	SPEAKER_07
 Is that going to be publicly available?

1:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 As far as I know, they have not.

1:01:52	SPEAKER_08
 So it's not near far, right?

1:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

1:01:59	SPEAKER_03
 If people were interested, they could talk to them.

1:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 But I got the feeling there was some politics on that.

1:02:04	SPEAKER_08
 That's one of my actions.

1:02:06	SPEAKER_08
 Just to check.

1:02:06	SPEAKER_07
 We should know what's out there.

1:02:08	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, I thought they'd only done farfew-wide intelligent room sort of things.

1:02:13	SPEAKER_08
 I hadn't known that they'd done anything.

1:02:14	SPEAKER_07
 Well, they only did the farfew.

1:02:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

1:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 I see.

1:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 But they had multiple mics and they did do recognition and they did do real conversations.

1:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 As far as I know, they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting.

1:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 But that could change because Mark's really into this.

1:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 We should do that in touch with them.

1:02:32	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

1:02:33	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I don't want to be sent out first note saying, hey, this list exists, but...

1:02:38	SPEAKER_07
 Is that an accident?

1:02:39	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I already had it.

1:02:40	SPEAKER_07
 That one.

1:02:41	SPEAKER_07
 I'm always going to do that.

1:02:43	SPEAKER_07
 So hopefully everybody here is on that list.

1:02:50	SPEAKER_07
 We should at least check that everybody here.

1:02:52	SPEAKER_07
 Thank you.

1:02:53	SPEAKER_08
 Everyone here is on the list.

1:02:54	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

1:02:55	SPEAKER_08
 I'm not.

1:02:56	SPEAKER_08
 I think you are.

1:02:57	SPEAKER_07
 We haven't sent anything to the list yet.

1:02:59	SPEAKER_07
 Oh.

1:03:00	SPEAKER_07
 We're just compiling.

1:03:01	SPEAKER_08
 I added a few people who I knew had to be on, even though they didn't tell me.

1:03:06	SPEAKER_08
 Like, change for your left boss.

1:03:08	SPEAKER_08
 You are on it, aren't you?

1:03:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:03:12	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm just just a clarification.

1:03:14	SPEAKER_05
 So, found data, they mean like established corporate linguistics and other fields, right?

1:03:18	SPEAKER_05
 Some things and stuff.

1:03:19	SPEAKER_03
 Some things and stuff.

1:03:20	SPEAKER_03
 They don't have to fund to collect.

1:03:22	SPEAKER_03
 And especially, well, I mean, found has also the meaning that it's very natural.

1:03:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's things that occurred without any...

1:03:29	SPEAKER_03
 These people weren't wearing clothes talking mics, but they were recorded anyway, like the congressional hearings and, you know, for legal purposes.

1:03:36	SPEAKER_05
 By any means, like standard corporate that had been used for years and linguistics and

1:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 marks aware of those. Okay.

1:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 That would be a found data because they found it.

1:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 And it didn't have to collect it.

1:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it's not found in the sense that at the time it was collected.

1:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 But what he means is that, you know, Mark was really a fan of getting as much data as possible from, you know, reams and reams of stuff, broadcast stuff, web stuff, TV stuff, radio stuff.

1:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 But he well understands that that's very different than this type of meeting, but so what?

1:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 Still, it's interesting for other readers.

1:04:13	SPEAKER_06
 So, like we're winding down, right?

1:04:16	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm.

1:04:17	SPEAKER_06
 Many ways.

1:04:18	SPEAKER_06
 Such a care of governance.

1:04:19	SPEAKER_06
 I'll buy the property.

1:04:21	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

1:04:22	SPEAKER_09
 I wish it could be on the same thing.

1:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yes, we could do that.

1:04:28	SPEAKER_08
 Now, I was already thinking about it.

1:04:31	SPEAKER_08
 This is made for task.

1:04:34	SPEAKER_08
 I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the cross-pad and the speech, especially the interaction of them rather than just note-taking.

1:04:43	SPEAKER_08
 So, can you determine the interesting points by whose writing can you do special gestures and so on that they have special meaning to the corporate?

1:04:52	SPEAKER_08
 I really like that.

1:04:55	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I just realized there's another category of interesting things, which is that I found this discussion very...

1:05:03	SPEAKER_05
 this question of how you get at queries, really interesting, and the fact that it's sort of nebulous, what kind of a query would be because it depends on what your purpose is.

1:05:15	SPEAKER_05
 So, I actually found that whole process of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting, but that's not really a specific fact.

1:05:24	SPEAKER_05
 We went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there, which I think was worthwhile.

1:05:30	SPEAKER_09
 I had a real revelation about taking pictures that I know why I didn't do this before.

1:05:34	SPEAKER_09
 So, I was very interested in making pictures of the words.

1:05:38	SPEAKER_09
 The points on really relate to this meeting.

1:05:40	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, it will take pictures of them, but...

1:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 They're related to this morning's meeting.

1:05:45	SPEAKER_09
 So, the previous meeting, that's right.

1:05:47	SPEAKER_09
 That's about it for some of them.

1:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to pass because I can't... I mean, Jane took my answer.

1:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'm going to pass for the moment, but come back to me.

1:06:02	SPEAKER_04
 Pass?

1:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think pass is socially acceptable, but I will say I will actually...

1:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's been on slightly different spin on what you said, this issue of realizing that we could take minutes, and that actually may be a goal.

1:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 So, that may be kind of the... in the sense test data, the template of what we want to test again.

1:06:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's generating a summary.

1:06:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, that was an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data.

1:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with Jane and Erica.

1:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up.

1:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 And it's something that, as you said, is her research topic in itself, so I don't think we'd be able to do anything on it, because we don't have funding on it in this project.

1:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 But so, it's definitely something I would want to do.

1:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to work... we're already been done on that.

1:06:55	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, expert systems.

1:06:59	SPEAKER_06
 I suppose we're like the part where we were asked what questions you were...

1:07:05	SPEAKER_06
 Well, being more management lately than research, I think the thing that impressed me most was the people dynamics, and not any of the facts, and I really enjoyed hanging out with this group of people today.

1:07:20	SPEAKER_06
 So, that's what really impressed me most.

1:07:23	SPEAKER_06
 Can we get a fine bag?

1:07:26	SPEAKER_08
 Well, we had people wearing the wireless mics all the time.

1:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I mean, one thing you could search for is where people laughing a lot.

1:07:36	SPEAKER_07
 I'd probably search for something like that.

1:07:41	SPEAKER_08
 That actually has come up a couple times in queries.

1:07:44	SPEAKER_08
 I was starting to land in, that was one of his examples.

1:07:47	SPEAKER_07
 When did people laugh?

1:07:49	SPEAKER_07
 Find me the funny thing that Jeff said.

1:07:51	SPEAKER_08
 So, we need the laugh detector, yeah.

1:07:54	SPEAKER_08
 Because it seems to be pretty common.

1:07:57	SPEAKER_08
 I'm nervous now.

1:08:02	SPEAKER_07
 Quiet and solving.

1:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think we're done.

1:08:06	None
 Okay, okay.

1:08:07	None
 Great.

1:08:08	None
 Can I turn it over?

1:08:11	SPEAKER_07
 I'm sorry, I can't turn it over.

1:08:14	None
 Please, return off.

1:08:17	None
 Do you have a job?

1:08:20	None
 Do you have a job?

1:08:24	SPEAKER_08
 Do you have a job, Jim, with me in the box?

1:08:27	SPEAKER_08
 I don't like that.
