0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, we're on. Okay. So I mean everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, our agenda was quite short. Oh, could you please add on two items which was digits and Possibly stuff on on forced alignment, which Jane said that was an and Ray's headed information on but they didn't. I guess the only other thing

0:00:27	SPEAKER_07
 Okay Okay, so there's digits alignments and I guess the other thing Which I came up prepared for Is to just see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting right?

0:00:45	SPEAKER_07
 so I mean digits and alignments

0:00:50	SPEAKER_03
 but Aligning people schedules. Yeah

0:00:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I mean right first alignment the people schedule

0:01:02	SPEAKER_07
 With whatever was a month and a half or something ahead of time the only time we could find in common roughly in common was on a Saturday

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 I Thought about having a conference call to include him in more in more of the meeting I mean, I don't know if we had if he had a telephone on the table. No, but he probably has to go do something right?

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right so we have we make for interesting noise background noise. Yeah

0:01:39	SPEAKER_07
 So we have to equip him with And we'd have to put lots and lots of digits

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 Real car noise

0:01:55	SPEAKER_06
 So anyway, I can talk about digits. Did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again? I mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well and And in retrospect, that's not a surprising as maybe it shouldn't have been as surprising as I as I felt it was The lapel mic is a very high quality microphone and as Morgan pointed out that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes Wrestling if no one else is talking. Yeah so

0:02:28	SPEAKER_07
 Well, it's yeah, so the breath noises in the mouth clicks and so forth like that though pal is gonna be better on The lapel is typically worse on the enclosed wrestling, but if no one's wrestling their clothes

0:02:38	SPEAKER_06
 Right, I mean a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading digits. So it's it's a very

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Different tasks than sort of neutral such during reading digits. Yeah, right

0:02:53	SPEAKER_07
 Right, right so in the digits in most most cases there weren't other people talking

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 The lapel likes to make a direction. They're typically don't know because I suppose you could make some that have sort of that you have to orient

0:03:07	SPEAKER_06
 They have a little bit, but they're not noise-cancelling so

0:03:11	SPEAKER_07
 They're intended to be on the directional right and and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on right now

0:03:18	SPEAKER_06
 So also and grace on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head and that will keep it from flopping or up and down as much

0:03:25	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, yeah, we actually talked about this in the friend-in meeting this morning too I think anything and it was I mean, they're the point of interest to the group was primarily that The the system that we had that was based on HTK that's used by you know All the participants in Aurora was so much worse than they than the SRI and the interesting thing is that even though Yes, it's a digits task and that's relatively small number of words and there's a bunch of digits that you train on It's just not as good as having a very large amount of data and training up a nice good big HMM also you had the adaptation in the SRI system which we didn't have in this so

0:04:14	SPEAKER_03
 No, or if you did I didn't think I think Stefan had seen them so Yeah A couple I don't remember but there was there was a significant And And that was the founder by the patient and then there was a very small Like point one percent of the natives Adaptation to the recognition hypotheses And I try both So

0:05:17	SPEAKER_07
 But I think one thing is that I would presume have you ever have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual T.I. Digits test set This exact same recognizer though it might be interesting to do that it's my because my sense

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 I have tried but I would do even slightly better. Yes or I are actually working on digits I could and they are using a system that's You know is actually trained on digits But otherwise it's the same You know the coder the same training Methods and so forth and I could ask them what they do yeah, but although I think it'd be interesting to just take this exact

0:06:00	SPEAKER_07
 Actual system so these numbers were comparable and try it on on T.I. Digits. Yeah, yeah, yeah Because our sense from the other from the Aurora task is that I mean because we were getting sub 1% Numbers on T.I. Digits also with the tandem thing so one so there were a number of things we noted from this one is yeah The SRI system is a lot better than the HTK This you know very limited training HTK system But the other is that the digits recorded here in this room with these close mics Actually a lot harder than the studio recording the digits I think you know one reason for that Might be that the still even though it's close talking there still is some noise and some room acoustics And another might be that I would presume that in the studio uh, uh, situation recording red speech that if somebody did something a little funny or not something a little funny or made a little

0:06:54	SPEAKER_06
 They didn't include it. They didn't include it. They made a good use. Whereas I took out the ones that I noticed that were blatant that were correctable Yeah, so that if someone just read the wrong digit I corrected it and then there was another one where Jose Couldn't tell whether I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six and I asked him and he couldn't tell either So I just cut it out You know, so just edit out the first word of the utterance um, so there's a little bit of correction But it's definitely not as clean as t i digits So my expectations is t i digits would especially I think t i digits is all American English right? So we probably do even a little better still

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 On the s r i system but we could give it a try Um, I was I thought that maybe that's actually

0:07:45	None
 good thing Because it gets in some of the The noises Um, hello Um,

0:07:55	None
 The Um, speech And um, I suspect that to get sort of the last Been out of these higher quality recordings you would have the These models that are portraying on lighter band data and

0:08:09	SPEAKER_07
 What's t i digits? I thought it's wide band. Yeah, it is wide band. We looked it up and it was actually 20 kilohertz sample. Oh, that's right

0:08:18	SPEAKER_06
 I did look that up. I couldn't remember whether that was t i digits or one of the other digit tasks

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 But I would yeah

0:08:24	SPEAKER_06
 So Morgan you're getting a little breath noise you might want to move the mic down a little bit

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 One issue with that is that The system has this The notion of a speaker Which would use an app patient

0:08:38	None
 And Um, You know And also The VPL

0:08:46	None
 So Yeah, I noticed the script that extracted it

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 So does Um, the t i digits database have speakers? Yep, there are now. Yep. And is there is there enough data or that I don't know

0:08:58	SPEAKER_06
 A terrible amount of data to the I don't know what we have in our acquaintance. I don't know how many speakers there are. Yeah, and how many speakers per

0:09:04	SPEAKER_07
 Outerance. Well, the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare it to the Sembers without the adaptation

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right, but I'm not so much worried about the application actually Um, uh, the, uh, VPL Right, if you have only one other speaker, my next reason is The Morgan

0:09:28	SPEAKER_06
 I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do Right, so, uh,

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 We might have speakers to the numbers and see what the data first speaker

0:09:36	SPEAKER_06
 Right, so we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent Um So although I sort of know how to run it, there are a little Few details here and there that I'll have to dig out

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it's the speaker ID from the white farm names. Right, I saw that There's a script and that is actually all in one script. So there's one script that parses white farm names And the text is like the speaker ID or something that can stand in as a speaker ID. So I have to modify that script to recognize the, you know, uh, uh, uh,

0:10:12	SPEAKER_06
 Speak as, uh, yeah, I did it. Right, and that uh

0:10:20	SPEAKER_03
 Or you can, you can, uh, Make names for these white forms that are that relevant and that we use here for that. Right.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_06
 I might have to do that any way to, to do, because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_06
 The other thing is isn't TI digits isolated digits? Or is that another one?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_06
 I looked through a bunch of the digits to corporate, corporate, and now they're all blurring.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because one of them was literally people reading a single digit.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_06
 And then others were connected digits.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, we had a bell cord corpus that we were using.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_07
 It was a bell cord. That's that was isolated digits.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can improve these numbers.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 It can improve the improvement by not starting with the switchboard models.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 By taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on the small and the digit data collected.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then we would adapt your models to the room acoustics and for the fun, if I could, you know, to the noise.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 And that should really improve things further.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 And then you use those adaptive models, which should not speak for adaptive, but sort of channel adapted.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 You use that as the starting models for your feedback adaptation.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah. But the thing is, I mean, when you, depends whether you're just using this as a starter task for, you know, to get things going for a conversation or for really interested in connected digits.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_07
 And I think the answer is both.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_07
 And for connected digits over the telephone, you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because somebody gets on the phone and says the number.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_07
 And then you just want it.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 You don't say it's better.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 But, you know, my impression was that you actually just a minute of the positive.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to, you want to, that's the obviously you can try.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 Right?

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have any, that's where the most requested list matches between the correlation and models.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_07
 So that's how you're doing stuff.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, so that'd be another interesting data point.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I guess I'm saying I don't know if we're going to do that with this.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_06
 It clips over your ears. There you go.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 If you have a strong, if you have a strong preference, you could use this.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think it has some spikes.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 So we use that.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 But you could if you wanted to.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, I don't know if you want to.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, your microphones a little bit low.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah. I don't know if we use that as the...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Give it.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_03
 So if you see a picture like this.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 And then you have to...

0:13:04	SPEAKER_06
 I already adjusted this a number of times.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I think these mics are not working as well as I would like.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I think there's too many adjustments.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_07
 Anyway, what I was saying is I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm that we compared all things to.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_07
 To have all of this at all this adaptation.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_07
 But I think it's an important data point if you...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_07
 The other thing that, of course, everybody was looking at was just that, the near versus far.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_07
 And yeah, the adaptation would get to some of that.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_07
 But I think even if there was only a factor of two or something, like I was saying in the email, I think that's a big factor.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_07
 So...

0:13:44	SPEAKER_06
 Liz, you could also just use the other mic if you ever promise with that one.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this would be okay.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 We think that this has spikes on it, so it's not as good acoustically.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 You're such a big...

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, mine are two.

0:13:56	None
 Everybody's here.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_05
 Hello.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you'd rather have this one then.

0:14:04	None
 Okay.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_06
 So to get that pivoted this way, it pivots like this.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, there you go.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_06
 And there's a screw that you can tighten.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_05
 Right. I already tried to get it good.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_06
 So if it doesn't bounce around too much, that's actually a good placement.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_06
 That's good.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_06
 But it looks like it's going to bounce a lot.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_07
 So where were we?

0:14:30	SPEAKER_07
 Digits.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_07
 So, I think that's an adaptation, an adaptation, factor two.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yeah, I know what it's going to be.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, no, no.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_07
 That we were saying, you know, well, is how much worse as far the near, you know.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, it depends on which one you're looking at, but for the everybody, it's the London factor two.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I know what I was thinking was that maybe we could actually try, at least looking at some of the...

0:15:00	SPEAKER_07
 The archivic capillary speech from a far microphone, at least from the good one.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, before I thought we'd get, you know, 150% error or something, but if we're getting 35%, 40% or something...

0:15:13	SPEAKER_05
 Actually, if you run though on a close talking mic over the whole meeting during all those silences, you get like 400%.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_07
 Right, I understand.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_07
 But doing the same kind of limited thing...

0:15:26	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, sure. Get all these insertions. But I'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in switchboard evaluations, or as...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_05
 You know who the speaker is and there's no overlap.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 You do just the far, like, for those regions.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, the same sort of numbers that we got those graphs.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_06
 We do exactly the same thing that we're doing now, but do it with a far-field mic.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, do it with a mic.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_06
 Because we extract the times from the near-field mic, but you use the acoustics from the far-field mic.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_05
 Right, I understand that.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_05
 I just meant that... So you have three choices. There's... You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts, but the segmentations were synchronized.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_05
 Or you can do a forced alignment on the close talking to determine that within this segment, these really were the times that this person was talking in, and the cells were in the segment. Other people are overlapping and just running those pieces, or you can run on the whole data.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_07
 But how did we determine the links that we're testing on in the stuff we reported?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_05
 In the HLT paper, we took segments that are channeled, time aligned, which is now being changed in the transcription process, which is good.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_05
 We took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here, because no one else had time any words in that segment.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_07
 They called that non-overlapping.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_07
 And that's what we were getting those numbers from. Right?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_05
 The good numbers. The bad numbers were from the segments where there was...

0:16:56	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we could start with the good ones, but anyway, so I think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those, and in those same segments just use one of the PCMs.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_07
 And then, you know, I mean, the thing is, if we were getting what, 35, 40% something like that on that particular set, does it go to 70 or 80, or does it use it so much memory we can't decode it?

0:17:19	SPEAKER_05
 I might have said that then, which speaker it is on how close they are to the PCM? I don't know how different they are to each other to be best.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_06
 For this particular digit ones, I just picked that one.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_07
 So, we would then use that. This is kind of central, you know, but I pick that one. It will be less good for some people than for other, but I'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_06
 I actually shouldn't pick a different one, because that could be why the PDA is worse, because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_07
 That's probably one of the reasons.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_05
 Well, yeah, you could look at, I guess, that, the PCM.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_07
 But the other is, I mean, even though there's, I'm sure, the SRI friend has some kind of pre-ampuses, it's still picking up lots of low frequency energy.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_07
 So, even discriminating against it, I'm sure some of it's getting through.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_07
 But yeah, you're probably part of it, it's just the distance.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_05
 And aren't these pretty bad microphones?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_07
 Yep.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_07
 Well, they're bad.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_07
 But I mean, if you listen to it, sounds okay, you know.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, when you listen to it, the PCM and the PDA, yeah, the PDA has higher sound flow, but not by a lot, it's really pretty.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_05
 It is, remember, you've got them to be cheap on purpose.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_05
 Cheap on terms of their quality.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_07
 Well, they're one at the 25 cents or so.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_06
 To be typical of what would be in a PDA, so they are, they're not the PCM $300 type. They're the 25 cent.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_06
 Buy them in tax of thousand times.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_07
 But I mean, the things, people use those little mics for everything, because they're really not bad.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, if you're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer, they, you know, you can hear the sound.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_07
 Hear the sounds just fine, you know.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, it's more or less the same principles as these other mics are built on.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_07
 There's just that there's less quality control.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_07
 They just turn them out and don't check them.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_07
 So, so that was, yeah, so it was interesting to me, so like I said, the front end guys are very much interested in this as well.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 So, but where is this, what's, what do we want from, yeah?

0:19:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that was going to be my question.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_07
 I think what we want to do is we want to, we talked about this in other contexts, we want to have the ability to feed it different features.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_07
 And then from the point of view of the front end research, it would be substituting for HTK.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_07
 I think that's the key thing. And then if we can feed it different features, then we can try all the different things we're trying there.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_07
 And then also Davis is thinking about using the data in different ways to explicitly work on reverberations, starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, the key thing that's missing here is basically the ability to feed, you know, other features, and also try to fix it.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_07
 And I don't know where I try to pull it back, but that's exactly what he's, he's sort of back, but he drove for 14 hours and wasn't going to make it in today.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's one of the things that he's doing.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, that means probably for the foreseeable features that you have to dump out, you know, if you want to use some features, you have to dump them into little files and give those files to the right person.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_06
 We tend to do that anyway.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_06
 So, although you can pipe it as well, we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep redoing it over and over.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, sorry.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_06
 So, that's exactly what the defile is for.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 The thing is that you actually have to dump out little files of each segment that you want to recognize. That's not the separate file.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_07
 Cool. Okay. So, the next thing we had in the agenda was something about linements.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, we have. Did you want to talk about it? I was just telling this to Jane. We were able to get some definite improvement on the forced linements by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_05
 Some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved as early as possible in the recognition, which is a...

0:22:55	SPEAKER_05
 I think it was both a pruning problem and possibly a problem with beating constraints on word-boundations.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_05
 And so we tried both these things. We tried saying, I don't know, I got this wacky idea that just from looking at the data that when people talk their words are usually chunked together.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_05
 It's not that they say one word and then there's a bunch of words together.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_05
 There might say one word and then another word, far away if they were doing just back channels. But in general, if there's like five or six words and one word far away from it, that's probably wrong on a error.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_05
 Then also the pruning, of course, was two severe...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 It's actually interesting. The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 And we had to lower that. We had to use tighter pruning up to Liz Ratz, who is showing that a run slower and there's no...

0:23:50	SPEAKER_05
 It was better with slightly better, it was the same with type.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_05
 So for a free recognition, the lower pruning is better. Probably because the recognition is just bad at a point where it's bad enough that you don't lose that.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 But it turned out to get accurate alignments, it was really important to open up the pruning significantly.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Because otherwise it would do greedy alignments in regions where there was no real speech yet from the front-end speaker.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 So that was one big factor that helped me do things. And then the other thing was that, as I said, we put in force the fact that the foreground speech has to be continuous.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 And you cannot have a background speech, hypothesis, or the middle of the foreground speech. You only have background speech at the beginning at the end.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, it isn't always true. And I think what we really wanted, whenever way to do this, from the data, or maybe some hand corrected alignments from transcribers, that things like words that do occur just by themselves alone.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 Like, back tunnels are something that we did allow to have background speech around. Those would be able to do that, but the rest would be constrained.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_05
 So I think we have version of it. It's pretty good for the native speakers. I don't know yet about the native speakers.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_05
 And we basically also made noise models for the different group, some of the mouth noises together.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_05
 So then there's a background speech model. And we also, there was some neat or interesting cases. Like, there's one meeting where Jose is giving a presentation.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_05
 And he's talking about the word mixed signal. And so I wanted to understand that you were saying mixed. I think Morgan.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_05
 And so your speech was saying something about mixed signal. And the next turn was a lot of people saying mixed. Like he means mixed signal. Or I think it's mixed.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_05
 And the word mixed in this segment occurs like a bunch of times and chucks on the lapel here. And he also says mix, but it's at the last one. And of course the aligner aligns it everywhere else to everybody else's mix.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 Because there's no adaptation yet. So there's, I think there's some issues about. We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_05
 But I guess I just tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker. And that's actually a little bit of a funky model. Like it gives you some weird alignments just because off the background speakers match better to the foreground and the foreground speaker.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_05
 So there's some things there, especially when you get lots of the same words.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think you can do better by cloning. So we have a reject phone and you and what we wanted to try with.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 Once we have this paper in one time. Cloning that reject mom and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground by fragment of the other.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_05
 Right. I mean, in general, we actually right now the words like partial words are reject models. And you normally allow those to match any word. But then the background speech was also a reject model.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_05
 And so this constraint of not allowing reject can be to be you know, it needs to differentiate which is just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_05
 And another one is turns like people starting with well, I think, and someone else is well, how about so the word well is in this segment, multiple times.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_05
 And as soon as it occurs, usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it. But then that constraint of sort of proximity constraint will push it over to the first person who really is.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_06
 Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint or did you do some sort of probabilistic way in distance?

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 I know it's a glitch. It's straightforward to actually just have a panel here that doesn't allow this. But we just didn't have time to play with the level.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 And really the reason we can't do it is that we don't have a round truth. So we would need a hand mark wood level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech between the speakers. And then use that as a reference and to the parameters of the volume that you often hear.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_07
 I was going to ask anyway how you assessed things were better.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_05
 I looked at them as two days.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 I was painful because the thing is the alignment share a lot in common. So you're looking at these segments where there's a lot of speech.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 A lot of them have a lot of words. Not by every speaker but by some speaker.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if you look at these individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words. But altogether you'll see a lot of words up there.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_05
 So the reject is also mapping. So I looked at them all in ways and just lined up all the alignments. At first it sort of looked like a mess.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_05
 And then the more I looked at it, well it's moving these words left word. And it wasn't that bad. It was just doing certain things wrong.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_05
 But I don't have time to look at all of them. And it would be really useful to have a transcriber who could use ways.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_05
 Just mark the beginning and end of the foreground speakers real words. The beginning of the first word, the end of the last word.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I have to ask you something which is first of all, does it have to be waves? Because if we could benefit from what you did, incorporate that into the present transcripts that would help.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 And then the other thing is I believe that I did hand. So one of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand marked it myself so that we do have the beginning and ending of individual utterances.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't do a word level but in terms so for one of the NSA groups. And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and did it utterance by utterance for that particular one.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think you do have, if that's a sufficient unit, I think that you do have hand marking for that. But it'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your wave stuff.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, you used to transcriber in it.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_05
 If you want to, well, Dan and I were, in terms of the tool, talking about this, I guess Sue had had some reactions, you know, interface wise if you're looking at speech, you want to be able to really wear the words.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_05
 So we can give you some examples of what the sounds that looks like and see if you can maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tools way or.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm thinking just incorporating it into the representation. I mean, if it's, if it's, if you have start points, if you have like time tags, which is what I assume is not what you, well,

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 that would be you as, I mean, we've been related to this format that the miss scoring code on the CTM conversation in that part. And then that's that's what I think transcriber output CTM.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_06
 I think so.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 It seems like she's, if she's moving time marks around since our presentation in transcriber uses time marks, it seems like there should be some way of using that benefit.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_05
 The advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin, you would be able, if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words, you would be able to like have the words located in the time.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_07
 So, so if we even just had a, it sounds like we, we, we almost do.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_07
 We're two, yeah, just trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that, you could actually get something, the good objective measure.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_05
 You mean not on the hand mark.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_05
 So, we only have, I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose, and our four is randomly, and...

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, not randomly.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_03
 Not randomly.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_05
 We know that it has these things in sort of a virus.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_05
 That's sort of average recognition performance and a bunch of speakers and meeting the point of view.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_05
 But yeah, we should try to use what you have.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_05
 I did re-run recognition on your new version of our one.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_05
 Good. The one with Dan.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that was the new version.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, actually it wasn't the new, it was the medium view, but we would do the latest.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 Did you adjust the utterance times for each channel?

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I did. And furthermore, I found that there were a certain number where not, not a lot, but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam's channel to Dan's or from Dan's to Adam.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 So there was some speaker, and the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before we had the multiple audio available.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 So I couldn't switch between the auto.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 I transcribed it off of the mix channel entirely, which meant an overlap.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_02
 I was at a terrific disadvantage.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 In addition, it was before the channelized possibility was there.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, I did it using speakers of my, you know, off the CPU on my machine because I didn't have a headphone.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_02
 So it was like, I mean, in retrospect, it would have been good to have got, I should have gotten the headphone.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 But in any case, this was transcribed in a less optimal way than the ones that came after it.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 And I was able to, you know, and this meant that there were some speaker identifications.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 When are there speaker labeling channels after interrupting this?

0:33:18	SPEAKER_04
 So you're referring to...

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, well.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 For example, you're running down the stairs.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_04
 I remember this meeting really.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm pan-pan-pan.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_04
 I'm very well-planted with this.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_04
 You can just read it like a play.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I can use it.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 And she said, and I know.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_04
 So there's one point where you're running down the stairs.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 And like, there's an interruption.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_04
 You interrupt somebody, but there's no line after that.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 For example, there's no speaker identification after that line.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 Is that what you're talking about?

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 Or were there mislabelings as far as like, Adam was...

0:33:48	SPEAKER_02
 That was fixed before...

0:33:50	SPEAKER_02
 I can't or said that pretty thank you for mentioning.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 I know that, that, I think went away a couple of reasons.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 But you're actually saying that's a...

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 I speak of herbicide.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so with, under...

0:34:00	SPEAKER_02
 Listening to the mixed channel, there were times when, as surprising as that is, I got Adam's voice confused with dance and vice versa, not for long utterances, but just a couple of places.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 And I bet it in Overlapse.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing that was interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of back channels, which were hidden in the mixed signal, which, you know, you can not too surprising.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 But the other thing that I hadn't thought about this, but I thought I wanted to raise this with respect to also a strategy, which might help with the alignments potentially.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 But that's when I was looking at these back channels.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 They were turning up usually very often, and I won't say usually anyway, very often, I picked them up in a channel, which was the person who had asked a question.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 So like, someone says, and have you done the so-and-so?

0:34:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then there would be back channels, but it would be the person who asked the question.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 And then people weren't really doing much back channeling.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 And you know, sometimes you have, yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be perfect, but it does seem more natural to give a back channel when you're somehow involved in the topic, and the most natural way is for you to initiate the topic asking questions.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think what's going on is back channeling is something that happens in two party conversations.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 If you ask someone a question, you're essentially initiating a little two party conversation.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, actually, when you look at this...

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's a back channel because the person is about to be involved in everything.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly, my point.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 And so this is the expectation thing, just the diet, but in addition, you know, if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the diet, but they might also give back channels to verify what the answer is at this point.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_07
 I tell you, I say a half-long.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_07
 Well, people are talking to each other.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_05
 There you go, but I think there are fewer ah-haves.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, just from, we were looking at word frequency lists, to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between and doing the line, the one that we want to be constrained to be next to the word.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_05
 And ah-hah is not as frequent as it sort of would be in pitch-work.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_05
 If you looked at just word frequency lists of one word, short utterances.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_05
 And yeah, it's way out there, but not ah-hah.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_05
 So I was thinking, it's not like you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's all I'll stop there.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's right. And that would make sort of-

0:36:10	SPEAKER_02
 And what you say is the other side of this, which is that, you know, so there are lots of channels where you don't have these back channels.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_02
 When a question has been asked, and these-

0:36:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's just probably less back-telling. So this good news, really.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_05
 Even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting, but we'll find out anyway.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_05
 I guess the other thing we should say is that we're going to compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_05
 And call home where we have those sides.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_05
 We can try to answer this question of, you know, is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in switchboard?

0:36:48	SPEAKER_05
 And we don't know what to do.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_05
 Try to create a paper out of that.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I mean, you folks have probably already told me, but we're intending to do a your speech to the mission.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_05
 You want to do tomorrow?

0:37:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we're still like writing the scripts.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_05
 We're doing the research.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_05
 You will, yes, we're going to try.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_05
 And I was telling Don, do not take this as an example of how.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_07
 Do what I say, don't do what I do.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_06
 You'll try to probably be a little late.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_06
 It is different.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_06
 In previous years, your speech only had the abstract to do by now, not the whole paper.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_06
 And so all our timing was off.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_06
 I've given up on trying to do digits.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_06
 I think that what I have so far makes a your speech paper.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we may be in the same position.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_05
 And I figured, we'll try because that'll at least get us to the point where we have, we have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 It's not very fancy.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a asking line by line format, but it does give you information.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_05
 It's the spurred format.

0:37:48	None
 Yeah, we're calling these spurts after, Chase.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_05
 I was trying to find what's a word for a continuous region with causes around it.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I know that the telecom people use, use spurred for that.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_07
 And that's, I mean, I was using that for a while when I was doing the greatest speech stuff because I, because I looked up and some books and I found, okay, I want to find a spurred in which, and because, because it's another question about how many pauses they put in between them, but how fast do they do the words within the spurred?

0:38:16	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we were doing.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_04
 First is used also.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_04
 Spurt.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_06
 Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other, with hard here in Mexico.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_07
 Just very locally, yeah.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_05
 I think it was Chase or somebody had the word spurred originally.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_05
 And so I, that's good.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I know Sue wrote about spurts of development, but in any case, I think it's a good term.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_05
 So we have spurts and we have spurredify.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe, maybe, maybe, Chase did.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_02
 I know, Chase dealt with, Chase speaks about intonation units.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe he speaks about spurts as well, I guess.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_03
 I've heard your stuff, so.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe someone has some ideas about how to do better, but we, there were taking these alignments from the individual channels.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_03
 We're, from each alignment, we're producing one of these CTM pod, which is actually has, is just a linear sequence of words, which we begin times for every word in the duration.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_05
 It looks like a wave's label file on all this.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_03
 So this is one of the first column has the meeting name, so it could actually contain several meetings.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_03
 And the second column is the channel.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_03
 Third column is the, start times of the words, the fourth column is the duration of words.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're, okay, then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into this sequence of words, the tags for like, where were sentence and sentence, question marks, various other things.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_05
 And these are things that we had done, the done sort of, propagated the punctuation from the original transcribers, so whether it was like question marks, a period, or, you know, comment and things like that, and we kept, and this fluency dashes, we kept those in because we sort of want to know where those are relative to that.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_03
 So those are actually, so retrofit into the time alignment.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_03
 And then there's a process where you now determine the spurts.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_03
 That is, actually, you know, you do that before you merge the various channels, so you identify by some criteria, which is pause length, but identify the beginnings and then the spurts.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_03
 And you put another set of tags in there, and keep those straight.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_03
 And then you merge everything and you know, linearizing the sequence space on the time marks.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then you extract the individual channels again, but this time, you know, where are the other people starting to end talking, you know, where their spurts start to end.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_03
 And so you extract the individual channels once spurred by spurred, and you're aware.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_03
 And then inside the words, or between the words, you now have begin and end tags for overlaps.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_03
 So you basically have everything sort of lined up in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think that's actually really useful also because even if you weren't studying overlaps, if you want to get a transcription for the carb-filled mics, how are you going to know which words, from which speakers, occurred at which times, relative to each other, you have to be able to get a transcript like this anyway, just for doing carb-filled recognition.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_05
 So, you know, it's sort of, hey, it's just an issue we haven't dealt with before, how you timeline things that are overlap.

0:41:46	None
 That's one thing.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I never thought about that.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, I mean, when I came up with the original data, it suggests a data format based on the transcription graph.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_06
 There's capability of doing that sort of thing in there.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_05
 So you can't see it directly from the transcription.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is like a command for the form, and it's a command script, not a command script.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_03
 There's lots of little things, like the 12 different scripts, which you can run at the end of the year, you have what you want.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_03
 But, at the last stage, we saw a way, the actual time information, all we care about is whether that this assertive word was overlap by someone else's word.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_03
 So you sort of, at that point, you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_03
 Because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do from paper.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_03
 But if you wanted to do a more frangering analysis and say, how far into the word of the overlap, you could do that.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's required more.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_02
 What's interesting is, it's exactly what, in discussing with Sue about this, she indicated that that's very important for all of us.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's nice to know, and also, I think, as a human,

0:43:00	SPEAKER_05
 I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur. So I can have two foreground speakers in a Morgan, and Adam, Jane, could all be talking, and I can align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time, and then look where they are relative to each other, and that's not really what I heard.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_02
 And that's another thing she said.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_02
 This is Bevers effect.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_02
 Where, in the second linguistics, you have these experiments, where people have perceptual biases as to what they hear.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you move things around until you get the best low information point that you can bring in the other person.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_05
 So it's actually not even possible, I think, for any person to listen to a mix signal, even equalize and make sure that they have the words in their line.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_05
 So I guess we'll try to write the zeros of each paper.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_05
 We will write it, whether they accept it later or not.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_05
 And the good thing is that we have, it's sort of the beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic features from each level to each other.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's a good thing about these papers.

0:43:58	SPEAKER_07
 You know, I might as well...

0:44:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if I can read the frame too.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, Jane likes to look at data, maybe.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_03
 You could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:44:09	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, it's a good thing about these paper deadlines and class projects, and things like that, because you're looking.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_03
 The other thing is that you usually don't tell your graduate students that these deadlines are actually not that strict.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, now it's out in the public.

0:44:25	SPEAKER_07
 This is secret information.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_06
 No.

0:44:28	SPEAKER_06
 No.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I'm going to do.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_03
 We have an interesting guy in the office.

0:44:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, one.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's a strict one.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_02
 Which sometimes means little ones with a string.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_07
 By the way, this is totally unfair.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_07
 You may feel, but the morning meeting folks actually have an extra month or so.

0:44:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_06
 There's a special Aurora.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_07
 There's a special Aurora session, and the Aurora people involved in Aurora have to really may or something to turn in their paper.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well, then you can just name them a submitter.

0:45:03	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, I can submit that to Aurora.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it's not a Aurora.

0:45:09	SPEAKER_07
 No, it's not a Aurora.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_07
 It's not the Aurora.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, it's actually a very specific.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_05
 Well, maybe it won't be after this.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_03
 But the people, I mean, stand in the middle of it.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_03
 The paper that is not an Aurora would probably be more interesting at that point because I'm already so sick and tired of Aurora task.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I thought you meant this was just the digit section.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_06
 I didn't know you meant it was Aurora digits.

0:45:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, no.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_03
 If you have this, if you discuss some relation to the Aurora task, like if you use the same...

0:45:33	SPEAKER_07
 This is not the Aurora task.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_07
 So they just do a little grab for it.

0:45:40	SPEAKER_03
 We are not sitting in the middle of it.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, in relation to other than the case.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_06
 Anyway.

0:45:47	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I know.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_06
 You could do a paper on what's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's an oral answer to the rule.

0:45:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, a digit is collected in a different way.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_07
 It's pretty hoax.

0:46:04	SPEAKER_07
 I think it's a little far-fetched.

0:46:06	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, the thing is that Aurora is a pretty close community.

0:46:10	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, you know, the people who are involved.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_07
 The only people who are allowed to test them are people who made it above a certain threshold in the first round.

0:46:18	SPEAKER_07
 Even in 99.

0:46:19	SPEAKER_07
 And it's sort of...

0:46:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's what you wanted.

0:46:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, not that they have a company system.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I mean, seriously.

0:46:30	None
 No, I'm sorry.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_03
 I mean...

0:46:36	SPEAKER_03
 In the particular system, I met this HTK backhand.

0:46:40	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you don't like HTK?

0:46:43	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have any stock.

0:46:46	SPEAKER_07
 No, I mean, this is the HTK that is trained on a very limited amount of data.

0:46:51	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe you should, you know, do you have more data or...?

0:46:57	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yeah, I really think that that's true.

0:46:59	SPEAKER_06
 But they had something very specific in mind when they designed it.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_06
 Well, so you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do.

0:47:09	SPEAKER_06
 But, you know, they...

0:47:11	SPEAKER_07
 But one of the reasons I have is Chuck's messing around with the backhand that you're not supposed to touch.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, for the evaluations, yes, we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.

0:47:19	SPEAKER_07
 But one of the reasons I have messing around with it, because I think it's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_07
 I always say very glibly that if you show improvement on a bad system, that doesn't mean anything, because it may not be show...

0:47:32	SPEAKER_07
 Because, you know, it doesn't tell you anything about the good system.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_07
 And I've always sort of felt that that depends.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_07
 You know, that if something...

0:47:39	SPEAKER_07
 If you actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it, it will report.

0:47:44	SPEAKER_07
 And in fact, most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_07
 Or sometimes it doesn't... not important. So I think that's an interesting question.

0:47:55	SPEAKER_07
 If we're getting 3% error on English native speakers using the ROR system, and we do some improvements and bring it from 3 to 2, do those same improvements bring the SRI system from 1.3 to 0.8.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you know, so that's something we can test.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_07
 So, anyway, I think we've covered that one up.

0:48:23	SPEAKER_07
 It's simply well.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_07
 So, yeah, so that's...

0:48:32	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you know, maybe you guys will have one.

0:48:35	SPEAKER_07
 You and Dan have a paper that's going in.

0:48:39	SPEAKER_07
 That's pretty solid on the segmentation.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:48:43	SPEAKER_07
 Still send you the final roadstrip.

0:48:45	SPEAKER_07
 And there are folks here who will definitely get something in on a rare.

0:48:49	SPEAKER_03
 So, there's another paper from the US speech paper.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_03
 But it's on digits.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_03
 So, a colleague has to realize that it includes version of M&E training.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_03
 And he tested it mostly on digits.

0:49:05	SPEAKER_03
 So, you know, it takes weeks to try it.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:49:10	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it's a very impressive result.

0:49:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's been a very noisy environment.

0:49:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure about the order of make from like 10% to 8% or from the 8.1%.

0:49:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it got better.

0:49:42	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:49:43	SPEAKER_06
 Hey, that's the same percent relative.

0:49:46	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_06
 20% relative gain.

0:49:49	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:49:51	SPEAKER_07
 Let's see.

0:49:52	SPEAKER_07
 I think the only thing we had left was some of those...

0:49:55	SPEAKER_07
 Well, there's a couple things.

0:49:57	SPEAKER_07
 One is anything that anybody has to say about Saturday.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_07
 Anything we should do in prep for Saturday.

0:50:05	SPEAKER_07
 I guess everybody knows about...

0:50:08	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, Mary was asking, was trying to come up with something like an agenda and sort of fitting around people's times a bit.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_07
 But clearly, when we actually get here, what things around this, as we need to.

0:50:20	SPEAKER_07
 But, okay.

0:50:21	SPEAKER_07
 So, we can't absolutely count on it.

0:50:23	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_05
 Are we leaving in here?

0:50:25	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:50:26	SPEAKER_07
 That was my thought.

0:50:27	SPEAKER_07
 I think this is...

0:50:28	SPEAKER_05
 We wanted an microphone.

0:50:30	SPEAKER_07
 No, I hadn't intended to.

0:50:32	SPEAKER_07
 We wanted... I mean, there's going to be Jeff Katrin, Mary, and two students, so there's five.

0:50:38	SPEAKER_07
 And Brian.

0:50:39	SPEAKER_07
 And Brian's coming, so six.

0:50:41	SPEAKER_07
 And plus all of us.

0:50:44	SPEAKER_05
 That's how fast we can.

0:50:46	SPEAKER_06
 It seems like too much coming and going.

0:50:49	SPEAKER_06
 Well.

0:50:50	SPEAKER_03
 Because it would be a different kind of meeting.

0:50:53	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I hadn't really thought of it.

0:50:56	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe they got the whole day, but just...

0:50:58	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe part of it.

0:50:59	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe part of it.

0:51:01	SPEAKER_06
 And make everyone read digits.

0:51:03	SPEAKER_06
 At the same time.

0:51:04	SPEAKER_06
 At the same time.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:51:06	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_05
 Is there an initiation in July?

0:51:10	SPEAKER_05
 Into our heart at Colter.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the sections that I know, right after...

0:51:15	SPEAKER_03
 I have to lie.

0:51:16	SPEAKER_03
 I have to stop watching.

0:51:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:51:19	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:51:20	SPEAKER_05
 So, when you...

0:51:21	SPEAKER_05
 I know the schedule.

0:51:22	SPEAKER_07
 You know, I just...

0:51:23	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, yeah.

0:51:24	SPEAKER_07
 I guess I sent it around a little bit.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_07
 Is it changed now?

0:51:27	SPEAKER_07
 I hadn't heard back from Mari after I...

0:51:29	SPEAKER_07
 I brought up the point about...

0:51:31	SPEAKER_07
 about the enderesis schedule.

0:51:33	SPEAKER_07
 So, maybe when I get back, there'll be some mail from her.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_07
 So...

0:51:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit more to saying representation.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_02
 That they...

0:51:42	SPEAKER_05
 We see that.

0:51:43	SPEAKER_05
 The two meetings from...

0:51:44	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I know about the first meeting.

0:51:46	SPEAKER_05
 But the other one that you get, the NSA one, which we hadn't done because we weren't running with the initial knowledge.

0:51:51	SPEAKER_05
 Because the non-A to speak it.

0:51:53	SPEAKER_05
 Five-nine to say.

0:51:54	SPEAKER_05
 But it would be useful for the...

0:51:57	SPEAKER_05
 to see what we get.

0:51:59	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:52:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's said 2011-21-1000.

0:52:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, three.

0:52:06	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:52:07	SPEAKER_02
 I sent email when I finished the...

0:52:09	SPEAKER_02
 that one.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:52:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I said.

0:52:14	SPEAKER_02
 I know the thing.

0:52:15	SPEAKER_07
 That part's definitely going to confuse somebody who looks at these later.

0:52:18	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, this is...

0:52:19	SPEAKER_07
 We're recording secret NSA meetings.

0:52:21	SPEAKER_07
 Not that NSA.

0:52:24	SPEAKER_07
 It's network services and applications.

0:52:27	SPEAKER_07
 There.

0:52:28	SPEAKER_05
 Out there.

0:52:29	SPEAKER_05
 No idea what they're talking about.

0:52:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:32	SPEAKER_03
 The other good thing about the lineman system.

0:52:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's not always the machines falling if it doesn't work.

0:52:37	SPEAKER_03
 So you can actually find...

0:52:39	SPEAKER_03
 Persons falling.

0:52:41	SPEAKER_07
 It's Morgan's fault.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_07
 It's always Morgan's fault.

0:52:45	SPEAKER_07
 It's always Morgan's fault.

0:52:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's always the transcripts.

0:52:49	SPEAKER_05
 Oh.

0:52:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_05
 I guess there are some cases where the wrong speaker...

0:52:54	SPEAKER_05
 these cases.

0:52:55	SPEAKER_05
 Not a lot, but where the wrong person...

0:52:58	SPEAKER_05
 the speech is attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it.

0:53:02	SPEAKER_05
 Or at least you can get clues to it.

0:53:04	SPEAKER_05
 I guess it does.

0:53:05	SPEAKER_05
 I'm the early transcripts that people did on the next single.

0:53:08	SPEAKER_02
 It also raises the possibility of using that kind of representation.

0:53:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if this would be something we want to check, but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized representation.

0:53:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think that my preference in terms of looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format.

0:53:25	SPEAKER_02
 And also, you know, soos preference as well.

0:53:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:53:29	SPEAKER_02
 But I mean, this is a better interface for making these kinds of, you know, local changes.

0:53:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'd be kind to...

0:53:37	SPEAKER_02
 I have no idea.

0:53:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think there's something that would need to be checked.

0:53:42	SPEAKER_07
 The other thing I actually had was...

0:53:44	SPEAKER_07
 I didn't realize this till today.

0:53:47	SPEAKER_07
 But this is Jose's last day.

0:53:49	SPEAKER_07
 He's missing.

0:53:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:53:51	SPEAKER_06
 Been acting a day tomorrow?

0:53:52	SPEAKER_06
 About meetings.

0:53:53	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, that's right, tomorrow.

0:53:54	SPEAKER_06
 Because if...

0:53:55	SPEAKER_01
 In the Sunday, I will come back to Spain.

0:53:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so I...

0:54:00	SPEAKER_01
 We would like to say thank you very much to all people.

0:54:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was good having you.

0:54:06	SPEAKER_01
 At least because I enjoyed very much.

0:54:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry by the result of overlapping.

0:54:13	SPEAKER_01
 I have a good result, Jett, but I...

0:54:19	SPEAKER_01
 I pretend to continue at Spain during the following months, because I have other ideas.

0:54:28	SPEAKER_01
 But I have enough time to...

0:54:31	SPEAKER_01
 Since Maun is not enough to research.

0:54:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm mainly for the topic, because it's all difficult.

0:54:41	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, maybe somebody else will come along and will be interested in working on it and start off from where you are also.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_07
 They make use of what you've done.

0:54:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:54:52	SPEAKER_01
 But I would like to recommend that...

0:54:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's funny, but the following to school or sleep...

0:55:02	SPEAKER_01
 Will be here more time.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_01
 My opinion is for us to spend more time here and to work more time in the topic.

0:55:15	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, it's a very short time.

0:55:16	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's once a hard and a year.

0:55:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:55:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's difficult, a lot better.

0:55:20	SPEAKER_01
 You are lucky and you find a solution in some few months.

0:55:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but I think it's not the beginning.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, thank you very much.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_01
 I've been discharged to...

0:55:38	SPEAKER_01
...20 years with you.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_01
 I hope if you need something for us in the future, I will be at Spain to help you.

0:55:53	SPEAKER_07
 Thank you, Sunsai.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:55:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:56:01	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, I guess...

0:56:04	SPEAKER_07
 Did it?

0:56:05	SPEAKER_07
...as something else, but we'd read our digits.

0:56:07	SPEAKER_07
 We'll do our last three or Jose's digits.

0:56:10	SPEAKER_07
 I'm sorry?

0:56:11	SPEAKER_01
 You prefer to eat chocolate at the coffee break or you prefer now...

0:56:18	SPEAKER_01
 We have a time.

0:56:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we have a time.

0:56:22	SPEAKER_07
 You're just people from that end of the table.

0:56:25	SPEAKER_06
 We've got to wait until after we take the mic off.

0:56:30	SPEAKER_06
 So we're going to do digits simultaneously or what?

0:56:34	SPEAKER_07
 We're going to do digits at the same...

0:56:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:56:40	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:56:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well...

0:56:43	SPEAKER_02
 Very nice.

0:56:44	SPEAKER_07
 That looks great.

0:56:46	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, it's all in the interest of getting to the...

0:56:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:56:51	SPEAKER_07
 You said yes.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_06
 It's the rest of the digits.

0:57:01	SPEAKER_06
 The rest of the digits are very clean without a lot of background noise.

0:57:06	SPEAKER_06
 So I'm just not sure.

0:57:08	SPEAKER_05
 What chocolate you're eating because they might make you feel sad.

0:57:12	SPEAKER_07
 I'm not sure for all because...

0:57:15	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, I'm actually kind of careful because I have a strong allergy to nuts.

0:57:18	SPEAKER_07
 So I have to figure out one without it.

0:57:21	SPEAKER_07
 It's hard to say.

0:57:24	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:57:27	SPEAKER_05
 This is a different kind of...

0:57:30	SPEAKER_07
 I may hold off.

0:57:33	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe I'll get some later.

0:57:36	SPEAKER_07
 Well, he's worried about a ticket.

0:57:39	SPEAKER_07
 Why don't we do a simultaneous one?

0:57:41	SPEAKER_06
 Remember to read the transcript number, please.

0:57:44	SPEAKER_05
 You left it me to the first time.

0:57:46	SPEAKER_07
 I did, and now I love it so much.

0:57:49	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, everyone ready?

0:57:51	SPEAKER_05
 You have to sort of...

0:57:52	SPEAKER_05
 I'm saying you haven't done this yet.

0:57:54	SPEAKER_07
 Wait, wait, wait.

0:57:56	SPEAKER_07
 We want it synchronized.

0:57:58	SPEAKER_02
 You've done this before, haven't you?

0:58:00	SPEAKER_02
 Did it together with us?

0:58:02	SPEAKER_02
 You mean at the same time?

0:58:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you haven't done this either.

0:58:07	SPEAKER_02
 The groupings are important.

0:58:10	SPEAKER_02
 So you're supposed to pass between the groupings.

0:58:13	SPEAKER_07
 So the groupings must be synchronized.

0:58:16	SPEAKER_05
 Synchronized digits.

0:58:19	SPEAKER_05
 We'll give everybody the same sheet.

0:58:22	SPEAKER_06
 What a good idea.

0:58:24	SPEAKER_06
 We could do the same sheet for everyone.

0:58:26	SPEAKER_05
 Have them all read them at once.

0:58:28	SPEAKER_06
 Or it's just same digits.
