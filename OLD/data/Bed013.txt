0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's usual. Yes

0:00:10	SPEAKER_03
 I was forgot it was a meeting Oh good 20 minutes ago. Thank you. What did I forget?

0:00:20	SPEAKER_01
 Scridge how the brain sort of does that

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 And turn all the alarms

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the news from me is a my forthcoming travel plans Yes two weeks from today Yeah, more or less I'll be off to Sicily in Germany for a couple three days

0:00:50	SPEAKER_03
 And what are you doing there forget?

0:00:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I'm flying to Sicily basically to drop off Simon There's this great verse and then I'm flying to Germany to go to a Mojo to Athens which is the meeting of all the module responsible people in smart com And represent ici I It myself I guess there and That's the actual reason and then I'm also going up to email for a day and then I'm going to meet the very big boss of convoyster in sub-routine and the system integration people in kaiserslautern And then I'm flying back via Sicily They dropped my son coming here on the 4th of July

0:01:53	SPEAKER_02
 And a great time to be coming back to the us of a God bless America you see the fireworks from your plane coming in

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure all the people at the airport will be happy to work on that day

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah We're not even better service than usual

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 We're aren't you flying on the tons of them I'll tell you That's not a big deal What you get to the United States it'll be a problem then

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 And That's that bit of news and the other bit of news is we had you know I was visited by my German project manager Who a did like what we did What we're doing here and B is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in august To actually work on us oh And we sat around and we talked and he came up We came up with a pretty strange idea And that's what I'm going to lay on you now And maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva because he has We know to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough So this is so weird that should even make you happy Okay Imagine if you will That we have a system that does all that understanding that we wanted to do Uh-huh based on utterances It should be possible To make that system produce questions So if you have the knowledge of how to interpret where is x Undergiven conditions situational user discourse on logical Conditions You should also be able to make that same system ask Where is x In a certain way based on certain intentions So instead of just being able to observe phenomenon Um and guess the intention we Might be able just Sort of Give it an intention and make it produce an utterance

0:04:21	SPEAKER_03
 But like in AI they generally do the Take in and then they also do the generation phase like Nancy's thing or You know in the hand Thing in 182 like not only was able to recognize which is also to generate based upon situations I mean that sort of thing absolutely

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 Once you've done that What we can do is have the system ask It's self An answer Ask something else and enter a dialogue with itself The basic the same idea is having two chess computers take

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 Except this smacks a little bit more of a skits of random computer

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you if you want you can have two parallel I'm asking each other what would that give us would a be something completely weird and strange and be If you look at all the factors We will never observe People Let's say in wheelchairs under you know under all conditions, you know when they say it x And there is a right at the goal and the parking is good. We can never collect enough data It's not possible, right But maybe one could do some learning If you get the system to speak to itself you may find breakdowns and errors And you may be able to learn And make it more robust maybe learn new things and And so there is no no end of potential things one could get out of it if that works And he would like to actually work on that for this

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 So they probably should be coming back a year from now

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I See that the generation bit making the system generate generate something this shouldn't be too hard

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, once the system understands things. Yeah, no problem I just don't think I think we're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well if we can get it to understand one thing like our worries run through We can also maybe a make it say or ask Where is X Or not? I don't know

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sort of having impression that getting it to say the right thing and the right circumstances is much more difficult than Getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on You know, I mean just as it's sort of harder to learn to Speak correctly in a foreign language rather than learning to understand it right?

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 I mean just the fact that we'll get the point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will always know exactly When it's correct to use that

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's it's Well, I've done generation and language for ductile research for four four and a half years and so it's you're right It's not the same as the understanding. It's in some ways easier in some ways harder. Yeah, but um I think it'd be a Fun to look at it or into that question. It's a pretty strange idea

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's the basic idea. I guess it'd be to give a lot of the system to have intentions basically Is that's basically what needs to be added to the system for it?

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think even think even what it would be the the prior intention So let's say we have to see that I mean no, let's we have to we have some some top down processing given certain setting Okay, now we change nothing and just say ask something Right

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 What would it ask? It wouldn't know what to ask It Unless it was in a situation we'd have to set up a situation where you didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there Yeah, which means it we'd need to set up an intention inside of the system right Which is basically I don't know where something is and I need to go there

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 Do we really need to do that?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 because No, I guess not

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's I know it's it's strange, but look at it Look at our baseness if we don't have Let's assume we don't have any input from the language Right so there's also nothing we could query the ontology, but we have a certain user setting If you just ask what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter something it'll give you an answer Right sure they are And so whatever that is is the generic default intention That it would find out which is wanting to know where something is maybe I don't know what it's going to be but there's going to be something that well you're not going to you're going to get a variety of

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Intentions out of that then I mean you're just talking about like given this user What's the what is it what is that user most likely to want to do?

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can have it sort of some user and context stuff and ask what's the Posterior probabilities of all of our decision notes You could even say let's take all the priors that's observed nothing query all the posterior probabilities It's going to tell us something right

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 Well it will Assign values to all the notes. Yes

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 And with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision notes Which if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent Answer out of that will give us the Intention x nihilo And that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance it would be based on that extension x nihilo Which we don't know what it is but it's there So we wouldn't even have to to kickstart it by giving it a certain attention or Observing anything on the decision note And Whatever that maybe that would lead to what is

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Undershastle or what is I guess what I'm afraid of is if we don't you know set up a situation we'll just get a bunch of garbage out like You know everything's exactly 30%

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so what we actually then need to do is write a little script that changes all the settings You know go goes through all the permutations which is we did it didn't we calculate that one?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 That was that was absurdly low and the last meeting because I went and looked at it because I was thinking That could not be right and it would it was on the order of 20 output nodes and something like 20 30 input nodes So to test every output node I would at least See said we two to 30 for every output node Which is very very large oh

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's nothing for those neural guys. I mean they trained for millions and millions of epochs. Well, I'm talking about

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 I was gonna think of my water Talking about billions and billions and billions and A number two to 30 is like it Boscow said we calculated out and Boscow believes that it's larger than the number of particles in the universe

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't know if that's right or not It's big It's just that's it's a billion right two to the 30

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's 30 is a billion, but if we have to do it two the 20 times Okay, then that's a very very large number. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's big because we have to query the node for every all right Uh, or query the net to the 20 times or not to excuse me 20 times. Okay. So it comes to 20 billion or something Yes, that's pretty big. That's big actually. Oh, we calculated a different number before. How do we do that?

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm. I remember there being some other one flittering around but anyway Yeah, yeah, it's anyway the point is given all of these different factors It's it's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever, but I think this will get us a bit closer at least right? I mean

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 If it takes us a second to do it for each one and let's say it's 20 billion then that's 20 billion seconds, which is Ava do the math Long I've heard some hours and hours and hours but we can do randomized testing

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 Which problem willistically will be good enough

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so it'd be it's an idea that one could for for example run run past um What's that guys for me No, you're usually here

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 You're in the group Jerry Jerry Felder. Yeah, that's Yeah, yeah, that would be the bald guy. Oh my advisor

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 And um, so this is just an idea that's floating around and we'll see what happens and What other news do I have Yeah, we fix some more things from the smart com system, but that's not really a general interest Oh questions. Yeah, I'll ask Eva about the e-base and she's working on that. How is the generation XML

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 Thing I'm going to work on that today and tomorrow. Okay. No need to do it today or tomorrow. You can do it next week or I'm gonna finish it today. I hopefully Okay I want to do one of the things where I stay here because if I go home I can't finish it. I've tried About five times so far where I work for a while and then I'm like I'm hungry So I go home and then I think I'm not going back Yeah, that or I think to myself I can work at home and then I try to work at home, but I fail miserably Like I ended up at Blake's last night I'm not conducive. No, I almost got into a brawl But I did not finish the smart com but I've been looking into it. I said it's not like it's like a blank slate I found everything that I need and I It's the furthermore I told Jerry that I was gonna finish it before I get back so That's approaching. He's coming back when next. Oh, I think we think we'll see him definitely on Tuesday for the nice or no Wait the meek's are on Thursday

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe maybe okay, but we'll see him next week. All right That's good

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah The paper

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm I was thinking about that I think I Will try to work on the smart com stuff and I will if I can finish it today I'll help you with that tomorrow if you're working I don't have a problem with us working on it though

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 So okay, so you would say it's funky cool

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it wouldn't hurt to write up a paper because I mean yeah, I was talking with Nancy and I said you don't know Whether you have a paper to write up until you write it up. So Well, since Jerry's coming back we can run it by him too, so yeah

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 What's your input?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, um, I don't have much experience with conference papers for competing the computer science realm So when I looked at what you had which was apparently a complete submission or just sort of said I didn't really know what to do with it like this is the sort of the basic outline of the system or whatever Or here's an idea, right? That's what that paper was here's here's one possible thing you could do Short eight pages and I just don't know What you have in mind for expanding like I what I didn't do is go to the website of the conference and look at what they're looking for or whatever

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it seems to me that

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 um Wait, is this a computer science conference or is it a

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 um Well, it's more it's both right it's it's sort of cognitive neuro psycholinguistic But all for the sake of doing computer science So it's sort of cognitive psycho Neuro plausibly Motivated architecture so natural language processing So it seems pretty interdisciplinary and I mean the keynote speaker is Tomasello Right so The question is what could we actually Do and and keep a straight face while doing it and I really can't keep a straight face doing anything My idea is well you can say we have done a little bit and that's it and Sort of the right position paper we want to also do that which is not too Good might be more interesting to do something like Let's assume We're right we have a steric closet a delusion of adequacy and take our where is accentance and say we will just talk about this and how we cognitively norally So Psycholinguistically construction grammar really Motivated in vision Uh, understanding that So we can actually show how we parse it That should be able to we should be able to come up with sort of a A parse It's on just just put it on

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that Ben harass you. Yeah, good

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you're will suffer in hell you know

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 There's a Diagram somewhere which tells you how to put that

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 That you have to put it on exactly like that so put that those things over your ears like that See the pathopuss the things are I shouldn't like that there you go

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, it hurts it hurts real bad

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 But that's what you get for coming late to the

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, this is your mic on yeah Talking about

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 Um, we're talking about this and it paper that we made just sort of Oh, which gentleman yeah and I just sort of Brought forth the idea that we take a sentence where is the part of tower and we we Pretend to parse it we pretend to understand it and we write about it

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 And on how all of these things Okay, then we pretend to submit into a major international conference

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 Oh It's the whatever architectures You know where there's this conference the seventh already international conference on Neuroly cognitively motivated architectures of natural language processing And keynote speakers are Tomasalo Oh, Mike why me make when he make when he I think so interesting like child language people. Yep Okay, so maybe you want to write something too

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 Why are they thinking of it? It says it normally like Like dialogue systems or you know

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 Even Neuro and

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 Uh learning and like

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 Comprehension production you can look at the website Okay, and the deadline is a 15th of June 10 year time why we've got over a week It would be nice to go right two papers actually. Yeah, one one from your perspective and one from or a pivot

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 I mean that's the kind of thing that maybe like um the general Can sort of like N T L is to like whatever the previous simulation based version maybe you're talking on the same kind of thing a general paper about The approach here would probably be good. Yeah, good to do some point anyway. Yeah

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I also think that if we sort of Write about what we have done in the past six months We we could Sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected which could happen Doesn't hurt because it's something we having it as a good good thing. It's a nice exercise. It's I usually enjoy writing papers. It's not I don't regard it as a painful thing And we should all do more for our publication lists and never hurts and Keith and or John O will go probably Will I in case of So the 22nd of September in South Brook and Germany

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so is the what you're just talking about

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 What would one possibly put in center?

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 What to write about What is on what's our take home message? What what do we actually because I mean it I don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do I mean It's obvious that we can do any kind of evaluation and have no you know, we can't write an ACL type paper We say okay, we've done this and now we're whatever percentage better than everybody else, you know It's part too early for that But we can tell them what we think I mean it's never heard to try And Maybe even that's maybe the time to introduce the the new formalism that you guys have cooked up

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 In the process, don't they need to finish the formalism? It's not even

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so it's a little thing

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 We said it was 4,000 lines is that it?

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know. Did you look at it?

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 It depends on the problem. Oh my gosh. Oh, I thought you were I thought we were talking about something which was

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, that's I mean, there's actually a problem. It's difficult. It's more difficult to write on four pages than eight

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and it's also difficult to even if you had a lot of substance. It's hard to demonstrate that in four pages

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that would be hard

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe it's just 4,000 lines. I don't they don't want any they don't have a tech style They just want us key pure ask you Lines whatever why for whatever reason I don't know not including figures and such Very unspecific

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just let's say that's closer to six pages actually 4,000 lines of asking okay 4,000 lines. I mean

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 Isn't it isn't it about 50 55 60 lines to a page?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't quote me on this this is numbers I have from looking how many characters are online? Okay, let's let's watch what we should should we discuss this over T and all of us look at the web I can't I'm wizarding today Okay, look at the web page look at the web page and let's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon For us to find it are like neural journal world and you will think you have a link. Okay. I got an email

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 By the way Keith is comfortable with us calling a cool Keith

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 He decided I'm chilling in the 510 Yeah Thank you and I'm also from the 212

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, yeah, I'm like to see sleep next In two weeks or not and a week of business in Germany I mentioned that for you and otherwise you haven't missed much except for a really weird idea But you'll hear about that

0:25:17	SPEAKER_00
 I do that you and I are you about that you already told me?

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no Yeah, that is something for the rest of the game. The thing with the goats and the helicopters Change the watch bed. It's time to walk the sheep Um Did you catch that illusion? No Presumably one of the water gate codes Anyways Um Don't make any plans for spring break next year That I'm shooting Tell me you're gonna do an interview in the your internal workshop in Sicily

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's what that's what he said

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 I've already got the funding

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 You'll get your flyers there Yeah, that's what it means. Okay, cool. You'll put us up too. I know I know about that part. I know about the almond trees Oh Too easy coconut High-neighborcy mango

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Too easy too easy I'm mango school everywhere so do kiwi okay. I was trying to find something that he didn't grow in his farm But cook another pineapple that's that's tricky. Yeah

0:26:50	None
 Sorry So but we have to decide what like sort of the general I need is um I mean we're gonna have an example case Um, right the point is to like this where is case? Yeah, maybe you have it would be kind of the paper hat would have in my vision a nice flow

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 If we could say here is the Here's parsing if you want to do it right here is Understanding if you want to do it right and you know without going to the technical

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 And we're not doing like those things right. Yeah, right would that be clear in the paper or not?

0:27:30	None
 That would be clear we would I Made around a little paper that I have yeah, we can sort of see this is No, I don't think you got it. See this if you if you're not around you do and for taking the discussion

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, come on So parsing done right so we can leave it say this is what it's sort of

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 state-of-the-art today Right and say this is bad. Yeah, and then we can say well what we do is this Okay

0:28:02	SPEAKER_00
 Parsing done right interpretation done right example

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and I'm actually getting to the cognitive neural part

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's the only that's the question mark. Don't you need to reduce it if it's a Or reduce it if it's a finite of neuro

0:28:20	SPEAKER_00
 I mean the conference may be cognitive neural doesn't mean that every paper has to be both

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and you can you can just point to the to the literature you can say the construction base

0:28:29	SPEAKER_00
 You know so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side although it could reference the anti-allage sort of like The fact that the meant is you're Where designed to be compatible with Yeah, I guess four pages you could I mean you could definitely It's definitely possible to do it It's just be small like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 But you can look in a yeah looking at that paper that that you had I mean, you know like you didn't really Explained in detail what was going on in the XML cases whatever just said really you know Here's the general idea some stuff gets put in there You know hopefully you can you can say something like a constituent tells you what the construction is made out of you know Without going into this intensity Yeah Give him the one paragraph whirlwind tour of what this is for

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 This would be sort of documenting what we think and documenting what we have in terms of the base net and stuff and since this never a bad idea to document things Yes, that's definitely a good idea There would be my We should sketch out the details maybe tomorrow afternoon if everyone is around You know you probably Wouldn't be part of it. Maybe you want think about it Um You may may ruin your career forever

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Hey you might give blacklisted and

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 The Other thing Yeah, we actually have we made any progress on what we decided last week I'm sure you read the transcript of last week's reading right so Up to date We decided that we're gonna take a where is something question and pretend we have parsed it and see what we could possibly Hope to observe on the first one

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 I came in and I started asking you about how we were sort of going to sort out the decision nodes

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 I remember you talking to me just that what you said Where it was like we needed to or in my opinion we need to design a base another sub-base net You know, it was whether it was whether we would have a base net of the output and on the input or whether the construction was gonna be in the base net Oh, yeah, and outside of it and

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 Was that the question was that what well that was it was related to what we were talking about

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Should I introduce to the pseudo square? Yeah, sure We have to put this in the paper This is this is my only constraint So the pseudo square I Saw the diagram in the other situation user Discourse right autonomy oh my god, that's amazing No way way

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 So

0:32:01	SPEAKER_00
 So once you start making full calls

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh god, what you know like su studio that horrible

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 I've blocked every aspect of football as out of my mind. Sorry. I haven't

0:32:16	SPEAKER_02
 He names in here

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, but also he's talking about suicide and that's that's not a notion I want to have it both

0:32:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, really I didn't really listen to it. I was too young. It sounds too rocking for that anyway

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 So what what so I wanted our constraints time and time

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we have tons of little things here and we can't believe that that's never been thought of before

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 What are the dots I don't remember what those little bugs

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you know these are our whatever believe that decision notes and they all contribute to these Oh Things down here That's you that's you we ask When the moment it's a base net and it has sort of 50 not yet specified interfaces Okay, I have taken care that we actually can build little interfaces To other modules that will tell us whether the user likes these things and the all these things and he whether

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 He's in a wheelchair or not supposed to be the international sign for interface. I think so yeah

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 I'd never seen it before either

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because things fit onto that And frankly, I've seen fashion

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 No, this is a hard-eat corporate agent Design, I don't know

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 There's maybe a different so wait what are these letters again the situation use or discourse and what about the utterance

0:34:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's the discussion of discourse. Yeah, this course is all things linguistic yeah

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 So this this includes the the current utterance plus all the previous utterances And for example Irina Gouriri which is going to be here And of July she's a new linguist working for email and what she would like to do for example is great for us. She would like to Take the end to on toilet so We have discussed in terms of the Eva Think of back at the Eva vector and John O coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the Discuss the admission fee in previously that might be a good indication that How do I get to the castle actually he wants to enter?

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 You know how do I get to X Discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance is a good indication So we don't want a hard code a set of leg seams or things that persons No to filter or search the discourse history So what would be kind of cool is That if we encounter a concept such a castle tower bank hotel we run it through the ontology and the ontology tells us it has Admission opening times it has admission fees it has this it has that and then we we we make a thosaurus Lexicon look up and then search dynamic the through the discourse history for Currencies of these things in a different window of utterances And that might you know give us additional input to believe a versus B or key versus a

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so you're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to Sorry, a few specific cues to some attention. You can dynamic look up keys. Yeah, oh, so wait

0:36:05	SPEAKER_02
 So um grip since since the sort of technical stuff is going over my head The point is that you that When someone's talking about a castle you know that it's the sort of thing that people are likely to want to go into or Is it the fact that if there's an admission fee then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in and then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something and then

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, blah blah the idea is even more general the idea is to say We encounter a certain entity in a in a in an utterance. So let's look up everything we the ontology gives us About that entity what stuff it does what roads it has what Parts whatever it has functions and then we look In the discourse whether any of that or any surface structure corresponding to these roads function has ever occurred And then the discourse history can tell us yeah or no, okay, and then it's up for us to decide what to do with it Okay, so So we may think that if you say Where's the theater Um whether or not he has talked about tickets before then we he's probably want to go there to See you something okay, where's the opera and perperes and lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it lots of people go to attend the performance and The discourse can maybe tell us what's more likely If we know what to look for in previous statements And so we can hard code for opera look for tickets do look for this look for that We look for Mozart look for this But the smarter way is to go via the ontology and dynamically then look up

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but you're still doing look up so that when the person so the point is that when the person says Where is it then you sort of say Let's go back and look at Other things and then decide rather than the other possibility, which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things you know like Prior to the where is it question they say, you know how much does it cost to get in you know to see a movie around here um Where's it close to theater the the point is that by mentioning admission fees that just sort of stays active now You know that becomes part of like those sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure and then Over in your base net or whatever when when the person says where is it you've already got you know since they were talking about admission And that evokes the idea of entering um then when they go and ask where is it then your enter note is already active Because that's what the person is thinking about. I mean, that's the sort of cognitive linguistic way and yeah

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 Ultimately, that's also what we want to get at I think that's that's the correct way. So of course we have to keep Memory of what was the last intention and how does it fit to this and what does it tell us in terms of the what we're examining I have further more I mean we can idealize that you know people don't change topics But they do but right even the for that there's a student of ours who's doing a dialogue act um recognition module so Maybe we're even in a position where we can take your approach which is of course much better Just to say how much harder is this program?

0:39:37	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm and much harder to program. Yeah, all these pieces fit together and And but okay, nevertheless, so these are issues, but what we actually decided last week is to this your benefit is to pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as where is the powder tower or where is the zoo and specify what what we think the the output uh observe out input notes for our baseness for the sub sub D for the discourse bit should be so that and I will I will then come up with the ontology side uh bits and pieces so that we can say okay we we always just look at this utterance that's the only utterance we can do it's hard coded like three needs sort of hand parsed handcrafted but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances and from ontologies and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces in terms of output so we need to find out what the various x construction will give us in terms of semantics and sem spec type things okay just where's x or any variance of that no um look at it this way yeah what did we decide we decided sort of the the prototypical where is x where you know we don't really know does he want to go there or just want to know where it is so the difference of where is the railway station versus where where where is green net

0:41:44	SPEAKER_03
 as i was just dancing sir we're not videotypical you're this so

0:41:58	SPEAKER_02
 so um we're supposed to the i mean we're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location right actually or i mean anyway the node in the uh the ultimate uh in the base net thing when you're done the the node that we're talking about um is one that says request for location true or something like that right um and and exactly how that gets activated you know like whether we want the sentence how do i get there to activate that node or not you know that's that's sort of the

0:42:45	SPEAKER_01
 issue that sort of the linguistics side has to deal with right well actually more the other way around we wanted something that represents uncertainty what in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is for example some to direct information and so this is prototypically founded the where is something question surface structure what which can be you know should be maps to something that activates both i mean the idea is to i don't know right okay let's have it fit nicely with the paper i don't see and how we would be

0:43:31	SPEAKER_03
 able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the utterance the i mean before before

0:43:36	SPEAKER_01
 we don't before we cranked it through the base net and we we wouldn't that's exactly what we want

0:43:40	SPEAKER_03
 we wouldn't no we wouldn't okay but then so basically it's just a very construction we have a node in the net right and we turn on yeah that node what what does this exactly what is the uh well given that we know that the construction has these two things we can set up probabilities we can basically define all the tables for every further it should be so we have

0:44:05	SPEAKER_01
 um let's assume we we call something like a lock x node and a path x node and what we actually get if we just look at the discourse where is x should activate or should should be both whereas maybe where is x located we find from the data is always just ask for the person once and no where it is and how do i get to is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there right so we want to sort of come up with what gets input and how in case of a various question so what what what what the outcome of of your parser look like and what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get squeeze out of that at once so define the the input into the base that based on what the utterance where is x gives us so definitely have an entity node here which is activated via the autology so where is x produces something that stands for x whether it's castle bank restroom toilet whatever and then the autology will tell us

0:45:37	SPEAKER_00
 that it has a location or the logical cells where actually it is located no not at all where it

0:45:44	SPEAKER_01
 is located we have a user proximity node here somewhere which tells us how far the user how far away the user is respect to that entity so you're talking about for instance the construction

0:45:57	SPEAKER_00
 obviously involves this entity or refers to this entity and from the construction also you know that it is a location is or a thing thing that can be located right autology says this thing has a location slot sure in that so thing that is being that is the content of the question that's being queried by one interpretation of where is x and another one is path from current user current location to that location so so is the question I'm not sure what the is the question for this particular construction how we specify that that's the information it provides or or castle work both sides right yeah you don't need to you do that it's just sort of what

0:46:44	SPEAKER_01
 what would be observed in that case observed when you heard the speaker say where is x or when

0:46:53	SPEAKER_00
 that's been parsed so these little circles you have by the d is that that's exactly what we're looking

0:47:00	SPEAKER_03
 for I just I don't like having characterizing the constructions with location and path or characterizing them like that because you don't it seems like in the general case you wouldn't know you wouldn't had to characterize them I mean or for when there could be an interpretation that we don't have a node for in the I mean it seems like make no more sense to have a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may versus uh saying this construction either can mean location or path and in this case since it can mean either those things relate both of those

0:47:35	SPEAKER_02
 up same thoughts questions I'm thinking about it it would be the same so I think

0:47:47	SPEAKER_01
 in here we have our goal there right and we have our info on so in my my case this would sort of make this happy and this would make the goal there happy what you're saying is we have a worries question worries node that makes both happy right that's what you're proposing but just my mind just as fine so if we have a construction node worries x it's gonna both get the posterior probability that it's informed up informed is true up and that goal there is true up as well which would be exactly analogous to what I'm proposing is this makes makes something here true and this makes something also something here true and this makes this true up and this makes this

0:48:38	SPEAKER_02
 true up as well I kind of like it better without an extra level of indirection to you know with this points to this point to that and so on because yeah because we get we get tons of

0:48:48	SPEAKER_01
 constructions I think because you know people have many ways of asking yeah sure I changed my mind

0:48:55	SPEAKER_00
 actually so I agree with that I have a different kind of question might be related which is okay so implicitly everything in you were always referring to the speaker intent right like what they want you know the information that they want for it's always information that they want probably some kind right all right this doesn't massage you or no okay so let's see so I don't know if the I mean if just there's more here that's not shown that you it's already like part of the system whatever but whereas X like the fact that it is you know speech act whatever it is a question it's a question that queries on some particular thing X and X is that location there's like a lot of structure in representing that yeah so that seems different from just having the no location X yeah it goes into it right pretty fast being this that's so that's that what you're

0:49:51	SPEAKER_01
 exactly we have some we have specified to okay the next one would be here just for mood the next one would be what we can squeeze out of the I don't know maybe we want to observe the the length of the words used and or the prosody and make conclusions about the user's intelligence

0:50:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of more linguistic meetings we've been talking about possible semantics of some construction right where it was the simulation that's according to you know that that corresponds to it and as well that it's discourse whatever contact discourse information such as the boot and you know other stuff so are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that that's tailored to this problem because that that has you know basically you know it's in progress does in development still but definitely has various

0:50:48	SPEAKER_01
 features slots attributes bindings between things that's exactly why I'm proposing it's too early to have to think of them of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe so let's just assume for the subset of human beings I'm not allowed to ask anything but where is X okay this is the only utterance in the world what could we observe from that okay that exactly where's X not

0:51:12	SPEAKER_00
 the the choices of where is X or how do I get to just where is X just where is X okay and but

0:51:19	SPEAKER_01
 you know do it do it in such a way that we know that people can also say is the town hall in front of the bank so that we need something like a WH focus should be should be there that you know this

0:51:34	SPEAKER_00
 whatever we do or do not take other kinds of constructions into account well if you if you can

0:51:39	SPEAKER_01
 okay that's not do where possible right if if if it's not at all triggered by our thing then it's irrelevant and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment but okay it seems like for instance

0:51:58	SPEAKER_00
 where's X the fact that it might mean tell me how to get to X like so would you want to say that those two are both like those are the two interpretations right the the ones that are location or path so you could say that this construction is a question asking about this location and then you can additionally infer if they're asking about the locations because they want to go to that place in which case the you're jumping a skeptic step and saying oh I know where it is but I also know how to get they wanted seem they seem to want to get their song and I tell them so there's like structure

0:52:31	SPEAKER_02
 right this it's not it's not that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two it's really about this but why would you care about this well it's because you also want to know this

0:52:41	SPEAKER_00
 or something so it's like you infer the speaker attend and then for a plan a larger plan from that for which you have the additional information you're just being extra helpful

0:52:53	SPEAKER_01
 think with this is just a mental exercise if you think about focusing on this question how would you design that is it do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already to to detect those plans and why would anyone care about the location if not you know and so forth or do you actually I mean this is perfectly legitimate and I would not have any problems with erasing this and say that's all we can activate based on the utterance out of context right and then the the miracle that we get out the attention go there happens based on what we know about that entity about the user about this really believes goes to the address blah blah absolutely fine but this is sort of thing I propose that we think about so that we actually end up with um um notes for the discourse and ontology so that we can put them into our base net never change them so we all there is as well as x and if I can play around with the observed things and we can run our better travel base and have it produce some output and for the first time in in in the world we look at our output and um let's see whether it's any good you know I mean

0:54:13	SPEAKER_02
 here's hoping right across your fingers yeah I mean for me this is just a bit better of curiosity

0:54:21	SPEAKER_01
 I wouldn't I would like to look at what this at-hark process of designing a belief net actually produce if if we ask it where is something and maybe it also enables you to think about certain things more specifically um come up with interesting questions to which you can find interesting answers and additionally you might fit in really nicely with the paper because if we run an example for the paper I suggest there it is yeah so this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper is saying you know people look at kinds of ambiguities and um in the literature verse bank and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon and we can say well that's all nonsense hey these things are never really ambiguous in discourse be don't ever occur really in discourse but normal statements that seem completely unabiguous such as where is the blah blah actually art terribly complex and completely ambiguous and so whatever everybody has has been doing so far and you know has been completely nonsensical and can all go into the waste paper but it's always a good way to begin yeah

0:55:58	SPEAKER_03
 and the only I am great all other useless nice overture but you know just not really

0:56:09	SPEAKER_01
 okay I mean exactly but that might be you know saying hey you know some stuff is is actually complex if you look at it in in in the vacuum and and ceases to be complex in reality and some stuff that's that's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum is actually terribly complex in reality would be nice sort of also a nice um bottom up linguistics um type message versus the old top down scroll I'm running out of time okay when do you need to start wizarding at 410 okay this is the other bit of news the subjects today no face or she can't be here and do the wizarding so I'm gonna do wizarding until it's gonna do the instructing also we're getting a person who just got fired from her job person from Oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once they leaves in August and um she's gonna look at it today which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue after the third after July we can we could and um and that's also maybe interesting four keys and whoever if you want to get some more stuff into the data collection I mean there's we can completely change the setup anytime we want okay look at the results we've gotten so far for the first whatever 50 some subjects 50 had 50 so far no we're approaching 20 now but until phase yeah leaving we surely will hit some higher numbers and so that's cool do more fun stuff yeah I'll

0:58:22	SPEAKER_02
 have to look more into that data is that around like because that's pretty much getting posted or

0:58:26	SPEAKER_01
 something right away when you get it or it has to be transcribed we have found someone here who's hand transcribed the first 12 okay first thousand subjects just so we can build a language model for the regularizer okay but um so those should be available soon okay the first 12

0:58:47	SPEAKER_02
 and I can I mean you know that I that I looked at the first the first one and got enough data to keep me going for you know the first July so yeah but you can listen to all of them from your

0:59:03	SPEAKER_01
 Solaris box if you want it's always fun
