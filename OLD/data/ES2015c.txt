0:00:30	SPEAKER_01
 Is everyone ready to start?

0:00:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, great.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_01
 Let's get the PowerPoint presentation up and running.

0:00:56	None
 Okay.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 On the agenda for this particular meeting, we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we came up with some general ideas of our design.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 And then we have to make some key decisions on our remote control concept and how we're going to make you what material we're going to use and that sort of thing.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 The meeting will be 40 minutes long.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we'll once again have Poppy as our first presenter.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 And now we'll switch up PowerPoint.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:01:36	None
 Okay.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 Should be just loading.

0:01:40	None
 Okay.

0:01:41	None
 Oh, I can't see it.

0:01:45	None
 Oh, okay.

0:01:47	None
 Okay.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I can't see it on my screen.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 That's just going here.

0:02:01	None
 Okay.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 We've been doing some research into the different components that we could use.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 What's available to us to actually make the remote control.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, we have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what is it happens inside the casing, which is more your field.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 The main internal feature is a circuit board, which contains all the electronics and also the contacts with the power source, which is not necessarily a battery is without to see.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 There are several components of the circuit board that we need to consider where we'll be getting them from, what they'll be made of, including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip, which is where all the main information is contained.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Diode, transistors, resonators, resistors and capacitors all need to be considered as well and all their positioning in the circuit.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 Are they all included, like mandatory or are these different options?

0:03:08	SPEAKER_00
 These, they're all different options.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 They're all separate apart from the chip, which we will probably decide whether we buy a simple or regular advance.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 We'll go into that later.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_00
 All the other things, the individual components that we'd have to get in separately and work out the most effective circuit, including all the wires and that and the LED of course, that's the light emitting diode.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got flexibility with colours and things with that as well.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 We could use a basic battery, but that brings with it, like, the need to be recharged and the bulk, the size of it as well.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 And they're not so great to dispose of environmentally.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 There's the hand-powered dynamo, which is the sort of thing that was used for torches 50 years ago, a bit out of date.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 What is a hand-powered dynamo?

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 Where you manually charge up the power, like you do everything.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 Just every once in a while?

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 Just every once in a while.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be kind of strange to always be kind of strange.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, be like going a step back in time.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it would really be with cutting edge technology.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's been used by some watches and other devices where you just shake the device and it gives it the power.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 The kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 Or the solar power, which we're considering inside a building, which is where it's going to be used, might not be quite so useful.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 But good to look into, renewable energy, always there.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 Lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think how it's comfortable and sits in the hand.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up or too small or too slidey.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 I know I've had a remote control before, which you couldn't tell, which was the front and the back.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 It had so many buttons on and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button because you can't really see what you're around it.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 We also can choose what materials.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 We could use metal, we could use rubber, which might be more ideal for the anti-RSI.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So it's very soft, not so stressful, on your hands.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 Wood.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Again, stepping back inside, we get there.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Titanium is not going to be possible, it's beyond our budget really, but would have been maybe for future projects.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 I have a choice for buttons as well.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 We've developed some good advances in technology with our research team.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 We've found some new multiple options, scroll buttons.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 I think that was brought up before.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 They're basically quite a flexible design, modern.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to use individual buttons.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 You can just slide up and down.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobile or computer laptop.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 One thing with the scroll buttons though, we would have to have an LCD.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 Display and the glow-in-the-dark thing.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if we have.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 Might be difficult.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_00
 We're going on to that later with the LCD.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 That means we need a really advanced chip.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's unlikely that that's going to be in our budget.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 Also, we've got the integrated push button, which is what we're most familiar with.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's most straightforward.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 You can incorporate that with the scroll button as well.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 Stations to make there.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 This is what I was just saying.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Four linked into the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 Simple.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 The settings button, regular, you could link with the scroll button and the advanced would have to go with a LCD display.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preference is I think we could go for the kinetic energy source.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's quite an advanced kind of technology.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's not been seen before so it could be quite a novelty factor, attractive as well.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_00
 So energy savings, you're producing the energy.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 You don't need an external battery supply or solar panels.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 So you just give it a shake.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds brilliant to me.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 Rubbing casing, I think we're probably the best if we're going for the anti-RSI and more choice with aesthetics.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 It could be pretty much any colour we want.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 It gives you more flexibility there.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 Probably the regular chip is supposed to be simple and we could possibly have the scroll and the push but no LCD because we probably can't afford that one.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 One concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as the exterior.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 This is the one thing that's protecting its innards.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think that would be more internal casing and the rubber would just be the what's in contact with the human hand.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 We're talking about putting on interchangeable plates.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see how a rubber plate going on top of it would stay there.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 If it was a clip-on plastic plate, it would work that way.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if it was just more of a rubber coating which was on to a case, the whole thing would be removable.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Plastic with rubber.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 I can't think of what.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 There is a certain phone that has a rubber casing.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 Or you can get outer casing for iPods and something that's just protective as well.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 It stops it, it will reduce the impact if it was dropped or something.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 It wouldn't damage its help.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a mixture of both.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 The actual remote would be hard plastic.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 That sounds good.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber?

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 As far as I know, it should be.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 I like the kinetic energy source idea.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know when people will be moving around a lot.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that it's worth it.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Kinetic energy source it can make.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 We can have any kind of style that would be as heavy or bulky.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 We can have a battery pack.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's a battery pack.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 There is a one battery.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 It was running off of one battery.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's an alternative just in case.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we could.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that could be the backup.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of a battery.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's so light.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 You can't watch TV in the dark then.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 But you don't need the solar all the time.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 It can be stored.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day, like a few hours a day.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think that might be a little impractical.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think sometimes it's just shoved under a cushion.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 People don't want to have to worry about that.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think, oh no, I've got to charge my remote.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's a kinetic thing I think that's the best about that.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's instant energy.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 You can shake it a few times or whatever.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 Or just like a big it up when you're going to use it.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of you don't have to make sure it's in the right place to charge.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the end of your presentation?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:12:24	None
 Oh.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's not on my screen.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't know.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know why.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know why.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think I just use the mouse.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 Awesome.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to go through the interface concept with use noise.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 First of all, explain what a user interface is.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's the aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise seen for example, a pair or a shelf, maybe a by the human user.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 There are two types of user interfaces.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 There's the graphical user interface which emphasizes the use of pictures for our fit and the point device for example, a mouse for input control.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Is that sort of like the schools I knew were talking about?

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:13:48	None
 Yeah.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an LCD screen.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe it's the buttons and pictures.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 So I suppose second time.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So the numbers are sort of like a keyboard.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 You're pressing the numbers for what you want.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 For the graphical user you must use some kind of presentation for the graphics.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose on some buttons you would have the power would be some kind of symbol.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 And if you wanted to go on to teletext or I know we're not having that.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 But I mean the similar thing is they have this little picture of a screen with lines across it which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the symbol on the button.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 But if we're having a simplified display anyway, that we would have to focus so much on that and be more than the numbers in the volume.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 It would be more a command interface.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a need to think of symbols for the volume to display.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 So it's just graphical for the pointing aspect.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 The infrared is like that's considered.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think it did you with the actual symbols that are on the buttons that are in the control.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_02
 So when it says pointing, it invites that doesn't include.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it could be a school or something and something could come up in the school.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're talking about LCD type things.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 But um.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're going to go with the command interface anyway.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 But the, we could incorporate some of the graphical user points as in just to make it nicer to look at maybe.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 What do you mean?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 Like, I can't think of an example, but sort of like little pictures rather than.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_03
 Like how the buttons signed instead of same volume.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 Like a little speaker.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 As a button though.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a keyboard in the shape of it.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 The.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 We've started with the command interface.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 This is the most useful.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 The little control.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 The less complicated.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 And the controls is the more than user.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 The more.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 The little control is the cheaper than you think.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 That would have more money in the budget to, um.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 Target the design.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 To face.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 Make it more trendy.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 And then it's no longer.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 Quite a new technology.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 We.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 We also have to keep in mind when we're designing our.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 More users and like.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of interfaces.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 The clutter buttons that.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 That the functions, colors and forms.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 Aren't always helpful.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons is all the different colors for different choices.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Things can be a bit.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 And that.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 All.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 All interfaces are different.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 Um, that doesn't improve the product.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to come up with something that's easy to understand.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe learn from these takes of all our interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use.

0:17:34	None
 Mm.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 Does anyone have any questions?

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think that we should keep.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 All the buttons to one same color just to keep it give it a simplistic look.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think if we go with the design plate thing, we'll have to.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 Just because of color clashing and.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 So I mean, depending on what comes out of the design, we might have to stick to just black buttons.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 But what about the lighting up effect?

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 I mean different colors for the lighting or.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 Um, well, um, I thought we had decided that we would.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 If you touch one of the buttons, they'd all light up.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 And so if they were black, it would be possible for them to light up.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see what you're saying.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if they were white, they would glow probably if they were made of rubber.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so you're picturing the light is coming from the back.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, oh, we're like coming from the back.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 I'd seem like an internal light.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 That comes through.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 So there would have to have to be some parts, maybe transparent around.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 But it's something.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 A little rubber is a more translucent product too.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be able to.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 Is that taken care of?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 And the phone that I was thinking of as well, when you change the, um, covers of it, the, the, the little buttons that actually, you know, that.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 Are behind the rubber.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't have to decide on one color.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 Each face could have a.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if they're raised up buttons.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 So that you can feel them, we were talking about it being more.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 A lot more tangible.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 It might be more difficult to do.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 If they're sticking up, if it's flat, then like, I don't know, like a cell phone or a mobile phone.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's like all very flat and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be possible. I don't think it would make that much difference.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the dimensions of it, because if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone, you can take off the hard cover and then there's the, like, so the buttons and then you get to the circuit.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it would matter that the buttons are bigger through the, the top casing.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure you could work out to fit in the casing without causing too much.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's fine.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 If it's doable, you can.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 That was good to me.

0:20:35	None
 Yeah.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's everything.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:20:39	None
 Okay.

0:20:40	None
 Is that my turn?

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 That means you're out.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 I have a shorter report for you today.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 It took a while to get this.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 You're not plugged in yet.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's a very good point.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go through some issues.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 real remote. We can work off of them and see how the fashion has changed. I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across. They're each more important than the one that comes after it. The first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel. This should be our priority, as we've been saying.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 The second most important aspect is that the remote control should be technologically innovative. I think we've done a lot of talking about that, just with lighting and the buttons in the face plates. It looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that. The third most important aspect is that their remote control should be easy to use. Pretty basic there.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 The recent fashion update, according to fashion washers in Paris and Milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furniture.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Also, in contrast to last year, the field and materials is expected to be spongy. Again, we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons. My personal preference is here. Of course, we've already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting, and I'd like to stick to that. The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us. It sounds something that you do use on kitchenware. I don't know if we want to do it on our moats. It could be one of the options, maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen. The temporary light-up idea sounds like we're going to stick to that, and then tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 The fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. Everything else we can really do, according to our plans already, given the market. But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for the world. It's everywhere.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen a lot of persons with olives on them. I think we stick to TV-based TV shows. They still need to fit into

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 people's decor, though. I think we could possibly take a more abstract design, look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables, and then just really strip it down to really basic shapes. We don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or a strawberry seed, or a really make it quite abstract if that fits in more with what we're doing instead of fruits and vegetables. If you look at it straight forward, it's a bit... It doesn't fit in with the trendy... Well, obviously, it does, if that's the correct theme, but maybe we could go more directly. I don't know. But initially, I don't know. I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 Not photos of fruits.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I was thinking, I don't know if you'll remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favorite animals. So maybe they could be animal-based, you know, because a lot of people have a house cat or a dog. That might be getting too specific, and we should see what the success of the first faceplates are. But it doesn't like to keep in mind.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 Did you have any questions?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Pretty straightforward.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 All right, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll need to hook up the PowerPoint again.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't for the first one, but I have now. It's still around, right?

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just trying to make this pop up now.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 All right, here we go. Okay, so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do. So energy we owe.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no, I can't write it in when it's in this setting.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know how to take it out of...

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 The PowerPoint key, I think.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay. So back to the decision. Energy, we've decided on kinetic range. Okay, so that's good.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to have a backup?

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm. Or do we just...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 But would a backup really be necessary?

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, will people just use the battery if there's no?

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and be bold and innovative and hope this works and well, hope that it works.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there's no reason why it wouldn't work, right?

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should just take advantage of using this with full potential. It can even be one of our selling points.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 It could be fully kinetic energy. Yeah, environmentally conscious.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 They're so just how important they just have to shake it a bit and that will be very light. Yeah, yeah.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 All right, the next decision is chip on print.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 I don't exactly know what that means. It's whether we went for the simple, the regular O of the advanced chip and that linked in with what buttons we were going to have. Right, and we were going for more simplistic style, right?

0:28:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but that was without the LCD, so that means we are not doing the advanced. So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons. I think we decided on the push buttons, right?

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the simple... Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting, the interior lighting system? Yeah, possibly. So it's probably going to

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 be the regular chip that we're going to need. So it's a medium. So regular chip. That's called medium or regular? Regular, sorry.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Regular chip. Oh, it was regular not simple?

0:28:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think. Yeah, if we... Because of the lighting that we've decided to

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 put in as well. Okay, and cases. So is this dependent on shape or what

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 it's made of or what? I think this is just going to be a very outside case which we both decided on rubber.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well I guess plastic and rubber. Coated in rubber.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic with rubber coating and inter-changeable.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 Inter-changeable, yeah, still going for that.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, inter-changeable, please.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 User interface concept. This is your time to shine.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 We decided on the component. I'm sorry, I've lost my um...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 Part one thing.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 So what happened? I think it was called command interface.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, yeah. Command interface. Command interface.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_03
 Command line interface here. Does it command line? Yeah.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Line interface.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_01
 All right, and supplements. What's that all about?

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I think that is... Well, we haven't really made any decisions about what we're going to do, like the cluster of button functions, collage and forms, and that and consistent use. Like what are our ideas to combat these problems?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Different interfaces are very different and can be confusing because the causes are different and the cause um, the different cluster chip buttons that they have.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 We haven't really decided what to do like that.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 Um, what are our choices here? Well, it's just um,

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 where, where shall we locate the buttons? What kind of functions will it shall we have? We like will have the numbers of the

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 channels and we'll have power, a channel changer, and volume, and power. So, just basic. Yeah, like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels, things like that, because

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 different televisions will have. Yeah, tone, contrast, and things

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 that's a bit... That was on um, one of my presentations about how often it was used. Do you remember that? Yeah, it was minimal.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it wasn't that I was hardly ever used. Should I bring it up?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah. I was told, visions will come with a remote. Yeah, and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well we know we want numbers. The screen settings was used

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 0.5 times an hour. So twice every once every two hours. Um, and it was considered a 1.5 relevance on the scale of 10.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's brightness color tone and all that.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think most of that comes like on the individual television set itself, isn't that? I'm sure it has its own buttons, so it don't necessarily need to have it on remote. Yeah, and different televisions, like we, I don't

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 know if we can make a remote that will be universal to all the different kinds of

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so we're just going for power, channels, volume.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 The other one was audio settings, mono stereo pitch. I mean, I sometimes use that. Some TVs will have the option of like living room style, movie style.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. And that they said that's used 0.8 times an hour, which is actually somewhat high, like almost once an hour.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, um, relevance of two.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we have five minutes to finish our media.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 All right, yeah. Okay, um, let's do this fast.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 Um, well that didn't come up on mind. Should we have audio?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 It only comes up on mind usually.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't, it's a problem with the international appeal.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work, but we know that everyone has this and it's the same.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess it affects the marketing because it, it is a good sales point to say, aren't you annoyed with the remote controls that have all these buttons?

0:33:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, that's it. And you can just go for it, make it a selling point that is just the basic. Yeah. All right.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 All right. Good. And okay, in closing, because we'll be at five minutes, we'll be meeting again in 30 minutes.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 Um, you'll be working, probably we'll be working on the look and feel design.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 Wait a minute, is that right? Yep. And, um, the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in and you'll be evaluating the product.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 Um, Poppy and Tara will have to work together, zoom modeling clay, and um, your personal coach will give you the best of the information of what needs to happen. Okay. All right. So,

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 anyone else have something to say? Um, I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect. Yeah. Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research? I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something, because yeah, yeah. Even if that may not seem obvious to us, if that's what the surveys brought out, I think we should probably go along with that. Yeah. Um, so I suppose that I'll come out in our design development, but happy to go

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 ahead with the fruit. No, do you guys need one idea of how many, uh, are you gonna come over casing ideas? Yeah.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_03
 We're not five. What are you thinking? What do you think of this? Um, having the numbers kind of like, not a bunch of grapes, but you know, like purple and kind of in a triangle. Mm hmm. Like grape. Yeah, you can have some fun with the buttons. It's

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 true. Yeah. We can have a nice idea. Yeah. I guess ideally you kind of think of age markets as well. So, yeah. Something that will, you know, appeal to the 15 to 25 year olds, something that your granny would want on her remote control. Yeah. Yeah. And international taste as well.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of things to consider. Lots of, all right. Okay. Yeah, we'll stick to the fruit veggie theme. All right. And, um, we'll reconvene in 30 minutes. Okay.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you. I'll see you later.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, what I just did.
