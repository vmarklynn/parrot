0:00:00	SPEAKER_05
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_04
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_05
 It's cool, we're dancing, they're saying it's like.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_05
 I've always wanted one of these, I really have.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_05
 Where did you buy them from?

0:00:55	None
 Hello everybody.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 Back again for another wonderful meeting.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Everyone ready?

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay we can hold on for a minute.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_05
 Oh my gosh.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_04
 I figured with the spam thing if you can't.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 I enjoyed it.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 Are you ready?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, right.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 First off we'll recap from our last meeting.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_04
 We got together to basically decide on what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing and who we all are and stuff like that.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_04
 We'll get a bit more of an idea together of what's going on.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 What we're going to talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we're doing, now we know that it's a TV remote and stuff.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 You guys have just been off doing some R&D for that.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 Research and development, I haven't heard that before.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_04
 There are all sorts of new terms and technology today.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 Whether they be on computer or on the white board or whatever you want, if you have any preference or order.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_04
 I'd like to hear on the Catherine actually first.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_06
 I think she's still finishing her.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_06
 I think she's still in the same position.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_06
 For the energy sources we can have a basic battery, hand in a mode which was used in the 50s for torches.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_06
 I think any of us remember the 50s.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_06
 It's like a crank thing.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_06
 You can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 There are sometimes combinations that calculate the two combinations of battery, but also using some solar panel.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_06
 Does anybody know?

0:05:55	SPEAKER_06
 I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_06
 For the case of the remote itself, there can be a general case which is just a flat one.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_06
 It kind of suits the palm of your hands.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_06
 The case material itself can be either plastic or latex rubber or titanium.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_06
 For each of them you have cases where, for example, titanium you can't use it if we're choosing a double curved case.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_06
 We can't choose titanium and if we're choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_06
 We just have to take that into account.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_06
 But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_06
 I think we discussed earlier, Rombi, or as I probably think so.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 That might be an idea of using a rubber, but then it's a squeezable ring.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_06
 It also doesn't break as easily.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_04
 When a TV program is watching the match and teams just lost you can fuzz it across the room and it will bounce off the wall back at you.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 I like that idea.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_06
 So rubber is the thing.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_05
 I think rubber is...

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 Rubber, we're all going with it, we're all like that idea.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 You think you can mark it now?

0:07:56	SPEAKER_05
 But after my fashion thing, I think you'll realise that rubber is more...

0:08:01	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, we like rubber.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_06
 And then there are the push buttons.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_06
 So you can have basic push buttons or a squall wheel like you have on a mouse.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_06
 Or you can have LCD to give you a display.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_06
 Squall buttons as well.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_06
 So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push buttons.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_06
 So if we're going for rubber, then we have to decide for the case.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_06
 And if we choose the double curved, then we have to go for rubber push buttons.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think we've decided that it's going to be a rubber case.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but if it's a double curved one or not.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_06
 If it's not a double curved, then we've got the choice for the push buttons.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_06
 If it's a double curved, we've got to go for rubber push buttons.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_06
 If that makes sense.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, push buttons instead of the wheel.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 If it's rubber, isn't it malleable anyways?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it doesn't matter if it's double...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, isn't a rubber case, I mean, it's completely flexed.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it flexes to whatever they want.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubber double.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 A rubber double double double.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 You see, you've got...

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, the energy.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 That's one thing.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 I'll have a big back, please.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_06
 Then you have...

0:09:21	SPEAKER_06
 The case is whether it's flat or curved.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_06
 And that's...

0:09:27	SPEAKER_06
 We don't care if it's rubber or not, but then we've decided that we're going for rubber for the case material.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_06
 So if we've chosen rubber, and now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat, single curved or double curved.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_06
 And I'm just saying, if we choose it to be double curved, then we need to go...

0:09:48	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know why, but we need to go for rubber push buttons.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_06
 So either...

0:09:56	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know, we just need to decide on the...

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 Let's have rubber push buttons, hi.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 Go rubber.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_06
 Let's go crazy.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_06
 And then do I have a last slide?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, I do.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_06
 So the push buttons themselves, they can be just simple, they can be...

0:10:13	SPEAKER_06
 So that's just the electronics behind the push buttons.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_06
 And the price that goes with it, so the simple push buttons are going to be the cheapest.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_06
 If we get a scroll wheel that's a higher press range, if we get an advanced chip, which is used for the LCD, the display thing, then that's even more expensive.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 Simple.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 Chip on print.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's a long print in through the infrared center.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 One I'm not understanding here is...

0:11:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_04
 Advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one PCB.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 And that's got all the electronics on one board, including the infrared center.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 What alternatives do we have to that?

0:11:28	SPEAKER_06
 Well, if it's not chip on print, then I guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and it doesn't include the infrared.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_06
 It's less expensive.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_06
 So technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job too.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_04
 So why would we not go for that?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 If it's something that's inside the unit.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't affect whether the customer is going to buy it or not.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 So let's not go for it.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_04
 And it's as long as it works.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, yeah.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_06
 I agree.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 So let's not bother with the chip on print.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_06
 So it's either the scroll wheel or the push buttons.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, push buttons.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_05
 What about the just the now sample sensor?

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 What about what?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_05
 The sample sensor.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what do we need to speak before in the remote control unit?

0:12:34	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I don't know.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_05
 Be cool.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_06
 It'd be cool, but they're saying they've just developed it.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_06
 I'm just guessing both.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_06
 It's going to be the most expensive option probably.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 The speech recognition option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's not something that we want to go into with the product.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can program a sample that when you say something with a response and you program the response as well, it's just clips that you record yourself so you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it, it says hello Rick or whatever.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's not.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 It would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the TV on like turn the TV on them.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 It comes on, but it's not that it's just gives you an answer and she gives you a verbal response.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, I mean, like what's the point of hello remote?

0:13:30	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I thought it was when they say really lonely.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, really lonely.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_05
 I thought when they said voice recognition, they meant like channel five.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_05
 Channel five.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 No, that would be promising.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a remote that talks to you.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, forget about it.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 I mean to certain cues.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so I'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_06
 So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_04
 Basic battery.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's cheap.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's cheerful.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's worked.

0:14:08	None
 It does work.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_06
 Cheap option.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_06
 Are you happy with that?

0:14:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_06
 So we'll go for the battery.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_06
 Then the case.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_06
 Do you want it flat or curved or single or double?

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 We were going with the late with the RSI rubber.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 So we wanted rubber double curve.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Do the yeah.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 So it will look like something like this.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_06
 Double wafer please.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_06
 So then if we use double curved case, then we have to use.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 We go for the simple buttons.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 So rubber push buttons.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's fine.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_04
 So it's cheaper still rounds.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds kind of funky.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 And we can also mark it as because we were saying earlier in your research.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have the people getting the complaining of RSI?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_04
 And this is anti RSI.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 So that's another marketing point that we can use.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, the rubber push button.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have to move?

0:15:06	SPEAKER_04
 Anything is going to have buttons.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_06
 I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_06
 You can still get.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_04
 You still get repetitive strain injury, whether you're pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's the fact that you're pressing the same doing the same movement.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's not actually what you're doing.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 But the fact that this rubber is actually used in these anti RSI.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's specific.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 We're giving them a way to burn off steam.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 So they can sit there and not that watching TV should be that stressful.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 And you can fuzz it across the room.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 Throw it at your children.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_06
 Alright.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_06
 That's me.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 Don.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, Gabrielle.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 Let's hear from you about the interface.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 Some of what I have to say ties into what Katherine was just talking about.

0:16:14	None
 Sorry.

0:16:15	None
 Wow.

0:16:16	None
 Okay.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm continuing with the user interface.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 The topic.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 It sounded like Katherine was also speaking with them.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 I also took Reese's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to include, what buttons we're going to include and how they're laid out.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 And so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we basically vetoed that idea.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's pointless.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a sample sensor, sample output.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the TV.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, they also give the, they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an mp3 player like iPod.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 So we've already addressed that.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 And I have a feeling that we're interested in something more general, but they suggested going a little bit into a niche like either gearing a remote towards kids or you could have a lot of colors.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 It might be funny or playful in some way or something for the elderly where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 But we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting, we really wanted something that was general, but done well.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 So the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want, you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing a long one.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 I can give you an example here of a good layout and bad layout.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 So this would be an example of bad layout where you have volume down, but they have a V on both of them.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's sort of confusing for the user.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have a good one?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 This is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 Brilliant.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Hello.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Something for kids.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think my personal preference is we've all talked about and seem to be on the same page.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 So I was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in the niche sense.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be more general.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't think the spinning wheel or the LC display were crucial for us.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it for me.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what are our definite decisions on this then as a team?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 The interface type we're going for.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 So we're not going to have any sort of display.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's just going to be buttons.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should have a limited number of buttons, ideally, I mean, power, channel up, channel down, volume up, volume up, numerical, keypad.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 And some sort of, we'll either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover or something like that.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's to the point where we need to decide about it.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 And we're not.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, now that we've decided.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 Are we going to, are we, are we decided on whether we're going to supplement it with anything, you know, colors or, you know, gimmicky bits to it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 We're not.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 We're just going to go for something.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like we wouldn't want to make it too busy and to sort of.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Dottie, but.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would say maybe a couple of colors like a, like a black with yellow in somewhere like maybe the R.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, Ducky.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, yeah, sure.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 If we want to have a lock of some sort of.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that should be.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I can speak with the button department, but I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents the other buttons from operating.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 So that should be simple.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:21:56	None
 Right.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_05
 And what the fashions are for next year.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_05
 So yes.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_05
 So from looking at this is trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the road control market.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_05
 We have found that from the road control market.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_05
 These are like most important aspects like we really need to, which we've already probably discussed.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_05
 The most important aspect is look and feel so the rock control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to be why should people buy this when everybody got a remote that came with the TV.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_05
 Second should be technologically innovative.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_04
 So what's that mean?

0:23:10	SPEAKER_05
 Technologically, it should be like.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_05
 Work.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_05
 Basically, I guess it should work.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 It should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, have something that's a little more technologically advanced.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 The trouble is, is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 That's cheap.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of gone away from because our rubber one is not fancy.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's different, but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 If that's what people want, then we we're going in the wrong direction and it's not technologically innovative.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 You know, maybe we could.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_05
 That's why I think in Bluetooth, because if you like put up Bluetooth and there's a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's going like, oh, because Bluetooth is in thing nowadays, like really.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 People and when it comes to marketing, like that's what people go for.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_05
 They don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day, where they works properly or not.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_05
 Of course they do.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 Well, they do, but it's not.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_04
 100% that's your first thing you go, oh, I'm not going to buy that because I don't know if it works or not.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but it looks good.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_05
 If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what do you two think about this?

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronize it with other electronics?

0:24:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't understand what.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's basically what it allows you to do.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and then this is just going to do all this is being used for is your television.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but I mean, people...

0:24:44	SPEAKER_04
 That would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no television does, does it?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 If you're looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 That would mean we'd have to make it television as well.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_06
 Bluetooth would, for example, in a volume thing to connect.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_06
 For example, if you get a call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_06
 You being called by this person right now.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_06
 Things like that.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 No, that would be your telephone syncing in with your television.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that wouldn't be the remote.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_06
 But if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to...

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 The television would have to be a Bluetooth.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's just trying to kind of advance it.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it doesn't have to be a Bluetooth.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 And there is no such thing.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_05
 Like, it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth. That was just an idea.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_05
 But like, it needs to be something that, you know, is new.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_05
 Whether it's a battery, it could be something really...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_05
 Really minor, you know? Like, but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_05
 And people have already seen it. People have already got it.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_05
 And...

0:26:09	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe the Canadian...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_05
 Just go creative.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_06
 For the vision of energy, then.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_06
 It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for...

0:26:17	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's very good.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_05
 I think it can market it. Never have to change the battery again.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_05
 And...

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 And this is all tying in very nicely.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about...

0:26:33	SPEAKER_04
 We should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_06
 And in little characters, you say, yeah, but not too much.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_06
 But yeah, by the squeezing it...

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating...

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's a great idea. Well done.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_05
 Third.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_05
 The most important aspect is...

0:26:53	SPEAKER_05
 Is it's easy to use.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_05
 And I think we've all...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_05
 All about that.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_05
 What's that?

0:26:58	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_05
 In the fashion, how it's supposed to look, next is fashion very much in...

0:27:03	SPEAKER_05
 Frozen vegetables.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_05
 Other than are like being themed for cloths, shoes and furniture.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_05
 So next year, people will be buying.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_05
 I found this really funny.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_05
 You know, strawberry shaped chairs.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got our keys that are like a broccoli key.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'll kind of...

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 I want to watch the pineapple channel.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_05
 And as it's rubber, the feel, which is in this year, it's spongy.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_05
 So it's not quite spongy.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's spongy.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's where we got that.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 We're ahead of the game there.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_05
 And so, personal...

0:27:41	SPEAKER_05
 What I was just saying, like...

0:27:43	SPEAKER_05
 Move away from the current.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_05
 Remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_05
 And change the look and feel while still keeping to the company's image.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_05
 Basically.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_05
 So yeah.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_05
 This is what I have to say.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_05
 So we're moving in the right direction.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_04
 No, this is good.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 So through all that, we're right.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to go back to going with the kinetic thing.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 That's great.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 Using the spongy rubber that we were talking about, that's anti-RSI.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_04
 As you squeeze it, you're not only therapeuticising yourself, you are charging the batteries.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 Mm.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how we...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 No vegetables.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but yeah.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_05
 Well...

0:28:38	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe make it like fruity colours or something.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_05
 Or...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 The power button could be like a big apple.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but apple would sue you.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is true.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 They don't own all images of apples.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_01
 So sue the Beatles, though.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_01
 We'll make it a pomegranate.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 A big pomegranate.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally agreed on is its image.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 Like, yeah, we're saying no, we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we don't know what it should be.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_04
 Or like, we're going, yeah, it should look slick, but what do we mean by slick sort of thing?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_05
 I think if it's rubber, it needs to be...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you said earlier on that it should be funkeys.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_05
 I think it should be...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what do you associate with rubber, you know, like really different colours?

0:29:46	SPEAKER_05
 Keep it clean.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, sorry, I used the wrong word.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_05
 What do you associate with the material?

0:29:52	SPEAKER_05
 The material.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_05
 That material.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_05
 Um...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_05
 Like, I'm just thinking bright colours.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_05
 Bright natural colours.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_05
 Nothing too...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Bright, but not too bright.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_05
 Like, no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_05
 It'll make it different colours, so anybody can do like...

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 Like, volume buttons should be all the same colour and the channel button should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_05
 And on the back of it, have the logo.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 What do you do?

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 Why not?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going too much down a gimmicky road of...

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, if somebody goes into this store, they're going to see like three or four normal remotes and then a big spongy pink tomato.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 What a nice present.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's the remote controlled bar though.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_05
 Like, and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, Well, I mean, I want to buy that one.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_05
 And parents will see the pro in it as well, because it's like kids won't break it.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_05
 It's not breakable.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_05
 We've thrown around.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 Especially with younger kids.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_05
 You know, they can pick it up.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_05
 And yeah, the only thing is that really small kids might chew on it.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's going to be too proof.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_05
 So, I'm going to write that down.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_05
 So it's quite, it's quite like user friendly and also for different families, like, like families as well.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_05
 Little kids and older, like teenagers will like it.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_05
 I think especially maybe younger girls, if it's in pink, they'll be like, Oh yeah, I think we're not controlled for their room.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_05
 So what do you say?

0:32:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we should mark it in different colors.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_04
 For different.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 So we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_05
 So like you walk in, you're like, Oh, I like that remote control because it's so bright.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_05
 And then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, Oh, what color would you like it?

0:32:22	SPEAKER_05
 And they go like, Oh, I can do the color.

0:32:24	None
 Wow.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_05
 So it puts, I think even the customer into more control of what they're buying instead of you got all color.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_05
 It's either that or nothing.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_05
 So they also get to pick.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_05
 Well, personally, I like walking into a shop and choosing a color.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that, that seems to work well with products like iPod, where you know you have a variety of colors that people feel like they're customizing it when they buy it.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_06
 You see how many, you know, there are some colors that I wouldn't, I would never choose and I'd be curious how many people choose that.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I suspect can be down to market researching, you know, that's easy enough to find out what colors are more popular.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_06
 Produce less of the colors.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well, um,

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 all right, that's what we're going to aim to get together by the next meeting then. Um, is from you, Catherine, you know, you're going to be working on the look and feel design.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_04
 Gabrielle, you're going to be working on, you know, come up with the user interface design, then basically you two are going to be working together.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Unless you won't be going off to separate offices.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 Um, and I think you're going to get a chance to play with some clay.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_04
 I think you know, come on, kick, you know, be it for the next meeting, be able to come in and show us some, some, some physical ideas.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_04
 Cause at the moment, you know, it's, it's hard. We were kind of going, yeah, it's got to feel nice.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's got to look cool and that it's, you know, now we can actually start, you know, some sort of physical, something or other.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_04
 That sounds great.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_04
 Um, and you're going to be working on the product evaluation.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 Um,

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 and I will be, uh, talking to the bosses, basically, and, uh, fielding off some more spam and, uh, that's it really.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 Keeping things, well, you know, hopefully, keeping things together. Um, yeah, that's, this is, this is, uh, good.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_04
 So we know for definite, you know, we've now got some definite things going on.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_04
 We definitely know how it's powered. We definitely know that, um, it's going to be a simple buttons. We're not going to be going for the new technological chip on print, the expensive things. So we, we're keeping the costs down.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's this rubber casing that we can sell as, um, fun and funky.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_04
 Don't have any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repetitive strain and injury.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 So this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 Supposed to fix it rather than cause it.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_04
 Um, this, you know, we're going to, we're going to, as a sort of extra something on it, you know, what, what extra things, other extra things this product have.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 We're looking to this lock key facility. I mean, whether or not it happens.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_04
 It's almost possible. I don't know, but something to look into.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. I think that's, um, well done, everybody.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_04
 Anyone have any, uh, any questions? Everyone know what they're doing?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Cause if you don't, you'll, I'm sure you'll soon get any mail about it.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think we all know what we need to do now.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_05
 This gives you a little detail.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Right. Well, it's, um, we're still a couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_04
 But, um, I got a note saying that you two will be working together.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 So before you disappear off.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not moving yet.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 Hold, hold fire.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 Um, does the pay raise immediately come into effect on our next paycheck or is that?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 Um, I think it's, uh, yeah, I think it's going to be part, part more of a profit sharing on the product.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_01
 So we're buying, I mean, we're getting futures and they come.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think, I think that's, I think that's the way it's going to happen at the moment.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 So we really have an incentive to make this remote work.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's really doing well.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 I want to share in the spice rocket.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 Did you see that this company sent a sign with my display ship?

0:37:37	SPEAKER_01
 This company has its fingers in a lot of different parts.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 What is it?

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 The money making department.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 I did notice looking at, I mean, they told you that they wanted whatever our product to represent the, the rr brand and to be immediately.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the corporate webpage, it's not obvious.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Our, our, well, it is to us because we worked here for years and we use that coffee machine.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 But it's doesn't have the color scheme of the company anywhere on it.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously it's just silver and black.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_06
 That's true.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_04
 And the spice ship doesn't have the, you think it have a massive hour and all down the side of it.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_04
 I still want one.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 I've just had a sign, but I should not say finish the meeting.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:01	None
 Yeah.

0:39:02	None
 Yeah.

0:39:03	None
 Yeah.

0:39:04	None
 Yeah.

0:39:05	None
 Yeah.

0:39:06	None
 Yeah.

0:39:07	None
 Yeah.

0:39:08	None
 Yeah.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that's us.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's not telling, it's not saying do anything in particular just yet.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe you should go back to your own offices.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_06
 Are we taking this off?

0:39:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.
