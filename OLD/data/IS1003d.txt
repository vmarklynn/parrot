0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry, not really.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks for being here.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_01
 Your judgment is biased.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 I need to do my control and stay for her time.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's go for our detailed design meeting.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, I will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have first the presentation by our user interface designer, David Jordan, and our industrial designer, Baba.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_01
 In case if we all agree on the fabric of building a C3 remote control, we'll evaluate the production.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe I will let our two designers talk about some...

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 I have slides.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 You have slides.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 This is our product prototype.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 This is made by Klin.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 It looks strange.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 The basic color is yellow and red. Yellow is our company color. I read it. It's more attractive.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 So, we use two basic colors.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 At the ship, there's two basic ships. The first is the cycle.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 And the second is the triangle space.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 We call it mushroom design. It looks like the mushroom design.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is the introduction of our product.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 Genetically modified mushroom, I will say.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the next slide. So, there are several key features of our prototype.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_02
 The first is that it is fancy. I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe I hope so.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_02
 The second key feature is that the circle channel selection.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 But now we have a suck circle. So, we can turn this ball to select channel.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite convenient for users to use it.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but don't touch. Don't destroy your first time.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. The third feature is the stable triangle base.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 This triangle base is very stable. So, it's unlikely you cannot find it.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, you can put it in the table. So, you can turn the ball to select the channel.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 And there's some cute button. You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 Everything's mushroom. So, we can call our remote control that mushroom.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_02
 It was not really mushroom because you have lemon shape.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's why if you put it in the table, careful somebody will eat it.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 I hope nobody will eat it anyway. You're trying to get the food aspect.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Mushroom was not in the trance.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 For its vegetables.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's vegetable.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's vegetable.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's something eatable.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 We integrated the different color.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 But this is not a mushroom anyway. So, it's fine.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable biasing.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 These colors.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 And spider color.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 And very sophisticated material.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, next slide.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 So, what I can add is that he talks about what is outside.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_02
 So, what is inside is what we talked about.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 The chip is a low level chip.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, we cut it.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 The low level chips inside.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 And the LCD button.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_00
 So, where's the battery?

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 The battery is under the base.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 In the base.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 And where is the solar set?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think it won't be, it won't Christ increase the price?

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we'll see after.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have the first.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, Mr. Monet, what's your opinion, according to this remote control?

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we're going to try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 We had three key points for this remote control design.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 And first one was fancy look and feel.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, we tried to judge this feature with a one to seven scale.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 One being no.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_03
 Just let me check.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, 4.3.5, it means it's acceptable.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 One being true and seven being false.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 So, do we have a fancy look and feel?

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think you have nice colors.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 The shape, the ball shape.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the shape is unique.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 The colors.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 I agree, it's unique, but is it really?

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, is it really fancy?

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 Do we define fancy?

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, fancy was defined by fruit and vegetable look.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 You have the lemon aspect of this.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 This is it.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe if you change, if you take the buttons out.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe do you think like that?

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know where the lemon is, but I mean, it's not obvious.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_02
 This shape is the lemon line.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 It would be more like a lemon.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_03
 If.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe improving the texture, like having less.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_03
 Less buttons.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, my mush.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 Looks like more fruit.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe a pineapple.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 And you know, you have the finger here with the buttons?

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a good idea.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 It looks more like a pineapple.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 What's the use for that?

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to tame the ball, I have no idea.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's embedded.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's the second point.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 The second point is we have to judge the.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 If it is fancy or not.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Fancy looking feel.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it better like that?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's say it's a pineapple now.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_02
 The color is the color acceptable.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, the color is okay.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's fine.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, the shame.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 It's like.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say there is more too much red.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_02
 Not too much red.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 In the basement.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, from one to seven.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'll give.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Seven is the maximum?

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, seven is false.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 And one is true.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'll give two or three.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Three, I will say three.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Three is fine for me.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Three.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 Is it better like that?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 Then, let me.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 What are the other criterias?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 Is it easier to use technically, technologically innovative?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 You said previously that there is some microphone inside.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is microphone ring.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's a microphone.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 And you have the microphone ring.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 There's the technology inside that recognizes simple vocal comments.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 And you can turn it so maybe it's techno.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 I have a lot of things around remote control.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but when you say technology, it's more in the core of the single.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 We have tactile buttons.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 I said you have microphone ring, but you have...

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's good.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's good.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 And you have this solar receptor.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's another really good point.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's not going to do it acceptable.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe two.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_01
 So using the same scale?

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 Two?

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 Two, yeah.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 You agree?

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Now, maybe the most critical one.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Last one I would like to judge is...

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 Is it easy to use?

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 The local common, yes.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 It might be easy.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it's stunning.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 Can you just explain me the...

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Can you just explain me the...

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's a print saying.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Please.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 This is the base.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 So you can tend to change the channel.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 I think maybe if you...

0:11:23	SPEAKER_02
 Like if you want to go from...

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I understand.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 If you take...

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Take from the remote.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 And you can turn like that to change the channel to...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but imagine...

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's quite easy to do zapping, but maybe it will be too fast.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not definitely convinced.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's the best way to...

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to jump from, I don't know, 1 to 20.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's different.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 How can you go directly to 20, for example?

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 It depends on the angle.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 But I mean...

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 You need to know...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 Is it the channel wide?

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be channel...

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think something that's three, channel four, channel five.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you have a click click click click click click click.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 Just imagine you have 50 channels.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 50 channels you buy the number by 330 degree.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 So you got how many degree you...

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you have to go through all the channels.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 When you stop...

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 When you stop the...

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 The tone...

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Then the angle you stop, it's angle you, it's the channel you...

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 How do you know this angle is the correct one?

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's very easy because you know how many channels are there...

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 So you count at one degree, two degrees, no?

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, you can do it.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's great.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think so, you can...

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think...

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 But the vocal common is easy to...

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 You can say 50.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, vocal common is okay.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 50, it's okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 So we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be...

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but when you're zapping, you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 So when you say I want to go to the channel number 20, that's you've decided to go to channel 20, so you can say channel 20.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 All right, yeah.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Or channel 4, because you really want to go on this channel, but if you really want to...

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 And this would be more for browsing.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 To do zapping, you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Seems to be good.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Good choice, Mr. David Jordan.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, you're famous.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 And whatever you do.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, what's this?

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 What's this?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 Cherry?

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you can...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 Also, the turner.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_02
 Turner for the tune.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 Turner for the tune.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's like fine from cost to fine.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 This is cost.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 This is fine.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's cost to fine.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's great technology.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this looks better.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you see, this is from one channel to...

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't see where it is.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's the turner.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 Turner for the tuneer.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 Turner for the tuneer.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, it's one of the...

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you have the vocal comment.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, it's...

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 On off.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 On off, yeah.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it has to be on to...

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time you have them.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's sleeping remote control.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sleeping.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's not the ecological...

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's why we have the solar...

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 To come back to the end.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 So, which number?

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 It is, it's very relative, but three, it's fine, I think.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's rather than a...

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do you agree?

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I agree.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, the reason about this is four is one.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 Three for me.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's...

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's okay.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's...

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and just take the...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Or what's your opinion?

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, we can even say, I mean...

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Those are sort of agree, but this one would be more five to me.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 Five?

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 I would like...

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is just a prototype.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 What do you...

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 What...

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 You compare with traditional...

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 To...

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Traditional controller.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easier than traditional controller.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 And now you don't have to put the button.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 You have...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 You just tend the...

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you know...

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's who kind of...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 The smaller...

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 So you can control the scale.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_02
 But in the traditional controller, how do...

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 How can you control the scale?

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 By pushing zero...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 You just put two buttons.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Zero.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's the first one.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 And one.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, you can do it.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 But you can also do it in the...

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 But if you do not want to browsing all the channels, you can just...

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 There's also a button here.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 And there's some buttons, okay.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 This function is just for your broadened.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 From one channel to the next one.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 The next...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's not what you say previously.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you're changing your mind...

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 This was the fine...

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Fine to course.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 Fine.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 And from 10 to 10 channels.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 Why do 10, 10 to 12...

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 10 to 20?

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 And this one, one, two, three, four, five, six.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 Like this.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 So there's different scale.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 So you can...

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 You can choose.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 But this...

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 This has to stay on the table, right?

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 This has to stay on the table.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 You can fuck on a flat.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 This is just a bit.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 You can just...

0:16:28	None
 You can...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 But then when you turn it...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Just right?

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 You can't put it out.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's just your turn in from the base.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 You need to have everything in hand.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 You need to put it on and turn.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 You know, that's the weak point because with the traditional one, you just have one hand.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Say, I've lost the remote control.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Nobody would take it.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you would never lose it on the...

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the next generation.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's the next prototype.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can change from...

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe for it's okay.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 For...

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 Easy to use for.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 You can save it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for it's more.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's even easier to...

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 You can...

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 You can error this.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:17:24	None
 Yeah.

0:17:25	None
 Yeah.

0:17:26	None
 Yeah.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for it's more than I would say.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 So average...

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 Nine over three?

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 Three?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's average, it's more than I.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 It need maybe some further work, but...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, especially on the easy to use.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 Absolutely.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 Target.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_01
 So the project is accepted.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 If you really want to have a fruitful, remote country.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 Is that fine?

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 We had a prototype presentation with the evaluation.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 So as we all agree to accept...

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the financial view.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to calculate the projection cost.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 As I said in the first meeting, when to have remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 And if not, if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 So just have a look at the...

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Here is the...

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 Excel...

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Shit.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 So as the energy source, we have Hundinamo.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 We don't use that.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 We have battery, right?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Not battery.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Kinetic.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have it, I suppose.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 But we have solar cells.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 How many do you need solar cells?

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think one would be enough for them?

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 Such as...

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's about...

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 You have three.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 Three batteries, three solar cells.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Electronic.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 Single, simple chip on print.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 Just one would be necessary.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 Simple, yeah.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 Zero for the others.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 And sample sensors and pull speaker.

0:19:57	None
 One.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 As we have voice recognition, I think.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:03	None
 Yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 So the case...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 It would be...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 So we are all already 19.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 Wooden.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 Keep on going.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Just have an idea.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, yes.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Wooden...

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 There's no good plastic just on anything.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but what about case?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's more like double curved.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's a little bit of a double curved.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, double curved.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, double curved.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 One, yeah.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 One, yeah.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, wood?

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 But it's...

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 A rubber...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want it's special color?

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 You may be too.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 Two special colors.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 Push button.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have four.

0:20:53	None
 Five.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:57	None
 Okay.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 Scroll wheel?

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's more like integrated.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think this will be like a scroll wheel.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you turn it.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe two scroll wheel eyes.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, true.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 We have the course to find a scroll wheel.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, no button supplements?

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have problem.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 As you display maybe.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 Interphase.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think with...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 If we keep on adding things.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have to...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 One of the key points is solar cells.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe if...

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 If suppose if we change and we put just one.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 Has it changed?

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it was actually...

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 It did change, but...

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 We have to switch to electronics.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 From the samples of the cell to regular tip.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 We have to delete the samples.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we have the voice recognition.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but this one, one of the features we were not able to...

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's the one...

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we have tumor and the first part in the basic version.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 It seems that this can be...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it would be better.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, wood into plastic.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 It should be fine.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 Plastic is free.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, do we need special color?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's one of...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have red.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 Red and yellow.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 Red and yellow.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 We can turn everything in either yellow or black.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_03
 Black then is a regular color.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 If we try to have a kind of...

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 Pineapple B.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 So, push button then it's the next...

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 But now I think this is one.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Integrated scroll wheel push button.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have only one.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 Push button.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Close to.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's...

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, remove maybe...

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 You have five push buttons so we can just...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 Try to modify some of them.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so what's the...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 Like...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 How about we change our color?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 Double curve.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 We can transform the double curve into single...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Something flat.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but flat.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Uncurved.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe not.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Single curve better.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_02
 Single curve should be fine.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 Ooh, quick.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we have only one.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 One you were left.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe don't...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 No battery on me, so myself.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think somebody gets...

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think there's a problem with the push button.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 We only need...

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Just one.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 One push.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Just one.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 That's fine.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, actually...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_03
 So, we have one button.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we have...

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, one button and...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 One scroll wheel.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 Scroll wheel with push button on it.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 And the vocal cover, it's fine.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's good they're not charging anything for them.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've done a good job as the cost is...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Could we have looked at...

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 Could we have looked at...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, it's wrong.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 We're not under...

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 The cost?

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's under our equal.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's not rated.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it's under our equal.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's under our equal.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, let's see...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Twelve.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Twelve.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 Fifty.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine, right?

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 Which part is the most defensive part?

0:25:12	SPEAKER_02
 Solar cells.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 Solar cells, right?

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 Is it?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Is it?

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make lots of advertisements...

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, to be able to sell to the same.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
...and concerning these solar cells to be...

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's a nice argument.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's still for our...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 It's really, really, really, really, very expensive.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe...

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we just have one button.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's easy to use in Powerful, as the remote controller has only one button?

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 Easy, you know, about Powerful.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 Easy Power.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to use.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't think we need to redesign the product.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 Or that's what we've just done.

0:26:16	None
 We've done it.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's under the...

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 If it was low, high and so...

0:26:22	None
 So...

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 Now...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, what are we going to do with this project evaluation?

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to just have to discuss it.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, did you enjoy your clay modeling?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 This is my job.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Was it a nice way to create your remote control?

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's a...

0:26:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's good to create a control instead of a computer.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, solar cells, and...

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 It is very informative for me.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 And for the marketing guy?

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 That was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're just presenting, one is presenting his stuff, next one his stuff, and then we try to combine afterwards.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 And new ideas about new products maybe, which would be fashion and yellow.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think you can think about yellow TV now after a food TV or I don't know.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 It can be interesting.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, just lemon.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just lemon TV.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 You know the traditional TV is flat.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's flat.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's square.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the chip is very boring.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's really boring.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's really boring.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Come up with new TV.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 With such as this kind of TV.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 So you can...

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 You can have this, triangle base, so you have the TV.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 The lemon TV with the pineapple remot control.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's...

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_02
 That is really interesting.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_02
 Because the TV...

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's interesting.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 We could do a kind of fruit collection of...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you like this.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
...electronic device.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 You just don't trust too much the trends.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Because fruit and vegetables last for 10 years.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe the message will be insects.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it's good to follow the flow and make it now and after, you know, if the people have changed their mind, you changed their mind.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long life product.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 TV is more like 15 years maybe so.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a lemon TV for...

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 We can think about TV with, you know, where you can change, you know, the aspect.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 So, like for the cell phones.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 You customize it every time.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 So every time you go to a channel, you just change the appearance.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, so, yeah.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 You can do it all the time.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 And keep the number up here.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and following...

0:29:13	SPEAKER_02
 The mood of person, the fashion.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's interesting.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can create a line of TV.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 TV.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 But TV for autumn and a TV for winter, you know.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, what is it?

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think the costs are within the project.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 We're just...

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's actually...

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 12.50 euros.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think you can celebrate your own?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 You can celebrate your creation.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can celebrate your leadership.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, thanks a lot.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I say yes.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 David Jordan.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's really a celebrating object.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's, you know, very...

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's very happy.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's a party.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very much control.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_01
 The thing now is to...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 to sell it.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's your job.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_01
 You sell it.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 You sell it.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 Good luck.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and the...

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 12.50...

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 12.25 euros.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 25 euros.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's...

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 25 euros.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 25 euros.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's...

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 25 euros.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe a little bit expensive.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a little bit expensive.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 No, I'm...

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's not so easy.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not so happy about the fruit chip, you know.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 What, really?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 It should be fine, you know, actually.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you eat it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you eat it.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you eat it.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can do a test, put it outside and you become...

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you become...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 I eat...

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 really fruit.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 But don't put sugar in it.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 The color I'm making is...

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 The color I'm making.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, actually...

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 No, the colors are...

0:31:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's perfect, yeah.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's perfect.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_03
 And two.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but the color, I think the color is more...

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 The yellow, more...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 The yellow, more...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 Still, that was one of the requirements we had.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I don't think it's such a problem.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 Just putting the logo somewhere.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 We can put some...

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe we can just integrate it on one side.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 The double R.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's a really good idea, so...

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have logo, we have the color, and we have the fashion in electronics.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have the slogan too?

0:31:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have give him...

0:31:51	SPEAKER_02
 Give him...

0:31:52	SPEAKER_02
 Give him...

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 A cute name.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 A cute man.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, mushroom control.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's the pineapple control.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 You cannot say mushroom because it's not the same.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's the pineapple now.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's changed.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's pineapple.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 Pine apple.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_02
 Pine apple.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_02
 Pine apple.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just flying saucer.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Let's carry him top.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's a flying saucer.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 And he didn't fire him once in one.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's pineapple remote control.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's fine.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 Would you buy one?

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'd try to.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 25.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's beautiful.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_02
 I can't...

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 I would try to work and see how easy it is.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you taught me you lost your control.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I already saw that.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 To need buy buy.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, if it is a universal, I can use it to my TV.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 One thing I like is the shape because, you know, it's not like the...

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 The remote controls you can put in your pockets, in your jacket.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 This is why, this is why.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 What do you choose?

0:32:48	SPEAKER_02
 I prefer the laser remote control.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 What do you choose?

0:32:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think I will choose this one because of the color.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's okay.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's you light your house and your home and your TV.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, maybe next if we decide to do something, we can put light inside.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_01
 That would be a nice one.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's gonna be expensive, you know.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 We have some problems.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think...

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Going to have euros and...

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 It would be interesting to just to see if we can...

0:33:17	SPEAKER_01
 If people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 If it's a new trend.

0:33:25	None
 Okay.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's fine.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, we can celebrate now.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's our new product.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Champagne, see you later.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_01
 Mr. Baba.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_02
 So bye-bye.

0:33:41	None
 Next time.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 We're eight by one.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:49	None
 I will close this.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 Go.

0:33:52	None
 So, I think we have...

0:33:53	None
 Finished.

0:33:54	None
 Yeah.

0:33:55	None
 Okay.

0:33:56	None
 Okay.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 I will close this.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Go.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think we have...

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 Finished.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:04	None
 Okay.

0:34:05	None
 Okay.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think we have...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 Finished.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 The designing and the evaluation of our remote control.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 And we have a nearly final product.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, final prototype.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Final prototype, right?

0:34:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you very much.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 Very predictive.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:34:33	None
 Okay.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_02
 So what is that storage in the remote?

0:34:47	None
 Mm.

0:34:48	None
 Yeah.

0:34:49	None
 A memory upgrade is closing so that the grid is in there.

0:34:53	None
 So, that should consume.

0:34:54	None
 Okay.

0:34:55	None
 Okay.

0:34:55	None
 Mm.
