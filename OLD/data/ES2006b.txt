0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, hooked up.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so now we're here at the functional design meeting.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully, this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time because this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the shared documents folder, I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh well, I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 So if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 And it should be in there.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm under what?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, project documents, yeah.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll put it in there.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 Is it best if I send you an email maybe to let you know it's there?

0:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, thanks.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'll do that next time.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'll act as secretary for this meeting in just take minutes as we go through and then I'll send them to you after the meeting.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 The main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go through each of you one by one.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 Then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the last minute.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 The last minute, I'm sorry about that.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 But we can see how that affects what you were doing.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 And then we need to, by the end of the meeting, come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be and what the functions of the remote control.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 And we've got 40 minutes to do that in.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 So I would say target groups.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 What does that mean?

0:02:17	SPEAKER_01
 So who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to have a fairly defined group that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the remote control itself.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 So with that, I think it's best if I hand over to you.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone have a preference for going first?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 I can go first.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just pull it out.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_00
 So from the.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 Just before you start to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we you don't have to go back.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 Just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 So with regard to the working design of this remote control, I've identified a few basic components of the remote.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 And from the design functional design perspective, we can now know what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_00
 So this is the method that I'll mostly be following in my in my row, the identification of the components.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 And since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 We'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and basically update and come up with a new design.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a cyclical process.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 So these were the basic findings from today.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 I just quickly jotted them down.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 So basically, as I told you, the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so the email said that teletext is now outdated.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Also the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features makes it more complex.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the variability of internet or television, however, our remote control will only be dealing with the use for television in order to keep things simple.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 Also the management wants that our design should be unique.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 So it should incorporate color and the slogan that our company has it standard.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so here is a functional overview of the remote control.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 There's basically an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 The user interface communicates with the chip.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll basically go over to the, okay.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 So if this is our energy source, this is a cell, it communicates, it feeds energy into the chip which basically finds out how to do everything.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 There is a user interface here.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 So when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal which then, so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code which is then communicated to the remote site which has an infrared receiver.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 There can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the essential.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_00
 So all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, make the chip more complicated and bigger basically.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 So in my personal preferences, I'm hoping that we can keep the design as simple and clear as possible.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_00
 This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 And also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and is compatible with most televisions, that's about it.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 So anything that you would like to know or do you have any idea about costs at this point?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's something to consider I guess if we're using more advanced technology it might.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 Certainly, yeah.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 So that, yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 But unfortunately I do not have any data so I just have identified the functional components.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 Are there any more questions or should we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think we need some general discussion at the end.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that will do.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so do you want to...

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think since we were discussing some design issues then I would like to continue.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think that has to come out of here.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 I thought those last minute things are going to hit us at worst.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, can we help?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 Should it just...

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it'll take some time.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_03
 It'll take some time.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's just not an interview.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 You need to then also press one.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, right, right.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 And f8.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 So the blue function key at the bottom.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 And f8.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, something is coming out.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_03
 It'll come up with...

0:10:32	SPEAKER_00
 No signal.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 No signal.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 Why?

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe again?

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, it says something now.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 My computer won blank now.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
 Adjusting.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_03
 Adjusting.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't see anything.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't see anything on my computer now.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 This is the problem.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, if you press function and that again, there's usually three modes.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 One where it's only here.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 One where it's only there and one where it's...

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so one more time.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 And now it's okay.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just wait for a moment.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 Adjusting.

0:11:13	None
 Okay.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's fine.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's start from the beginning.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm going to speak about technical functions design.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Just like some first issues that came up.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the method I was adopting at this point, it's not for the whole period of the project.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's just at this very moment.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 My method was to look at other remote controls mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web, just to think about what they usually really need and what the user might desire as additional functionalities.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then just to put the main function of the remote control in words.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 So the findings where the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 So this is quite straightforward.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 And some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 Then the user would like to switch the channel.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 For example, just changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 Or the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we would need the numbers.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 And also the volume is very important.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 So could you go back for a second?

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 Switching on off channel.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Among the findings, I found that most of the presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design, like operating a VCR, but they don't seem to be able to deal with DVD players.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 But then there are, surely there are many other functions that could possibly be added to them.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 But according to the last minute update, actually we do not want to have all these complicated functions added to our design.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 So my personal preference would be to keep the whole remote control small, just like the physical size.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then it must be easy to use.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 So it must follow some conventions.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 Like we're about to find the on-off button and maybe the color tends to be red or something.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 Then, yeah, the most-have buttons would be on-off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next of the previous channel.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 And then volume has to be there.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_03
 But then other functionalities could be just, there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 Then, for example, brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 So for the time being, that's all if you have questions.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that was the directive that came through from management.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 But if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video on DVD, I could get back to them and see if it's just whether it's worth arguing about.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and also it's-the question is because there are so many different-and there are so many different things that could possibly be included.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 Besides video and DVD, there are video CDs and whatever.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things.

0:15:44	None
 Okay.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 Are there any questions for clarification of Marika before we go on to the next one?

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 So in the user interface requirements, we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 But so at this stage, how we go about implementing those buttons, we will not identify or I mean, we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of fancy user interface or something like that.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 But is there any thoughts on that?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think the buttons are still kind of the most easy for the user to use.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, what other options would you have, a little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 And I mean, the user just wants to get a result quickly, not to spend time in like giving several orders.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, I think I would think the buttons, but if you have other proposals.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think the costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 So we can probably wait until we have more knowledge on that.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 If the costs allow, we can have like an LCD display and because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 Cool. Do you want to give me a little cable thing?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, am I going in the right direction? No.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 Wait here.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I'm getting hungry.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, here you are.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_04
 That's why we meet.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, cool.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_04
 You said?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for your requirements.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 We need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on the right.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 Hello.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 We try to transfer.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's working.

0:18:39	None
 Okay.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_04
 So, what I have, like where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with 100 subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_04
 So it was all about how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_04
 We'll see most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and LCD screens in remote control.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_04
 They actually gave me any answers on the LCD screen, so I should have taken that back.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 Anyway.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_04
 So, what they found is that people don't like how common remote controls are.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, definitely we should be looking at something quite different.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 75% of users find remote controls ugly.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 The other 25% are no fashion sense.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 80% of users would spend more to get, you know, a nice looking remote control.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 Current mode controls.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 They don't match the user behavior well, as you'll see on the next slide.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what zapping is, but switching between channels sort of randomly going through.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control?

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 It is make it look ugly.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, this is one little bit difficult to see.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 If you explain it to us, it'll be fine.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Well, I can send it to all of you.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_04
 What it is is it's cones because I thought they'd be more exciting.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 I like that.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, come back.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to stop playing with the little thing.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 So, like, what it shows is how much things are used relatively.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 And what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 What you can't see is volume selection is a little bit higher than all the others.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 That's the next one along.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 So, what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 And the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 And so, the numbers are not on the top, but present there, like, they're important, you know, so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that?

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 You know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential and the power, while it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I didn't understand that it could fit.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 And everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control because they're just not needed and they're not used.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 This is the bit that the email messed up for me.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I was fiddling about with the beginning of the thing.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Say.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 So, this is what people find annoying about remote controls.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_04
 And that they get lost, that they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think if you're watching enough TV to get repetitive strain injury from, you know, watching TV, then that's the least of your problem, but, you know, it's up there.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, the RSI thing would be that, like, when you have the computer keyboards and you need the rest up, it would be something that encourages, you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and, you know, not strain ink, you're at rest watching TV.

0:22:27	None
 Yes.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 This is pink because I was copying and pasting the table.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't have time to write it out again.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's all right.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 But that shows how people, whether they would pay more for voice recognition software.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 So you can see from that that, you know, younger people, the age of 35, are quite likely to pay quite a lot more, well, quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more skeptical about it and they're less willing to try it.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 So clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but, you know, I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV, you know, tends to be people talking and, you know, how you're going to stop it from just flipping channels or watching TV.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:23:22	None
 Okay.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 So these are my personal preferences.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, sleek, stylish, sophisticated.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 You know, so something that's a bit cool, you know, functional.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 So it's useful, but minimalist.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 There's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got this stuff and you're just like, what the hell is that?

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 Who is ever going to use it?

0:23:55	SPEAKER_04
 You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we need to aim for both.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 Then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier, and, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then like a locator.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, kind of like you have a mobile phone or not a mobile phone.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Some kind of a ring.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's it, you know.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 Whistle on it.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_04
 And it's weird, my flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into you this morning and I was like, I need to get off everything.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something, a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the TV, you know, because you don't want you remote control beeping every five minutes because you, you're deliberately losing by throwing out the window or something.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's me.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's you.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to take this.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've got about 10, 15 minutes to discuss.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Cape Cat Cat's presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_00
 So if you need to have a target group, then I think as far as the motto of our company is concerned, if you want to have something sleek and, you know, good looking, we are better off targeting a younger audience than, you know, people who are comparatively elderly.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for more stylish remote control, but I'm assuming, you know, yes.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 But the survey did say that things like voice recognition are more popular with them.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want to put in something stylish, then it will certainly be more popular with the younger people as compared to older people.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 Then again, I guess where it was most popular was the 15 to 25 brackets.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't know how often they are buying television.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it?

0:26:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't have much money generally.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 I would share a television or something.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's more that 25 to 35 when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 But still, if you can go back to that slide and how popular was it?

0:26:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's all right.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 If you can just look it up on your computer.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_00
 People between 25 to 35, how popular was it?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 It was still quite popular amongst them.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 So even they are 76% of their height.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 I know what you're saying about the 15 to 25 yards, but it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like, I mean, if you're at university, you're paying your rent, but you don't have a mortgage.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_04
 You don't have a life insurance policy.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_04
 Usually not a car.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 Normally you have a car.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 So you're more likely to move.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_04
 You're more likely to see that.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's cost more than a car.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, like it is an age group to target really.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 And if we're talking 25 euros, it's a price that's not unaffordable even for...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, I mean, that's what it's like.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 15 pounds, you know?

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 This is not unaffordable, but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a TV.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know many people without a TV.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 But today, the TV last year, and everyone thought we were off our heads.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 But the TVs are often kind of somewhat old TV that's well-balanced.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 Listen, yeah.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 And the strange stuff.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's more control, like, not even remote.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 It might not even function whether it's TV.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we've...

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 But even in the case of 25 to 35, it's quite popular, right?

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we're still, yeah.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe we can just kind of...

0:28:11	SPEAKER_04
 I think the fact that, you know, 91.2% of 15 to 25-year-olds are saying, yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_04
 And the world is saying quite a lot, really, you know.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, that and the disposal of Bullencom, I don't think it's something to ignore, you know.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but at the same time, I think maybe we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target, because actually, I mean, they are all still good young people.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a massive difference, yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if we take 15 to 35, but that one does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 Is that going to happen in an implication?

0:28:49	SPEAKER_00
 I was having a general outlook on most sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself, I'm not very sure about, because one of the things that Kat pointed out was, how do we go about implementing it?

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 You do have any mobile phone they don't need, because you have, like, I mean, every mobile phone now has, like, call this person, and it calls it there.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 How frequently do we use it anywhere, and how good is it, you know, voice recognition software is still quite...

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 But with a TV remote, it's going to be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on, off, channel 5.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Louder.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, that should be relatively simple.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_04
 You would maybe need a code word, do you know what I mean? So, like, when you say change, so that's been said quite a lot on TV, so maybe, like, you know, remote.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, how often do people say remote on TV? Although I only watched Charms, so really, I wouldn't let it be.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 But, like, say, just say remote 5, you know, remote 10, remote 1.29.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 So, it seems like a feasible thing to implement. Yeah, but maybe if you want to look into that just to check.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, if we go for the 15 to 35 age group.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but then of course we're going to get anyone who's older than 35 who wants to look young and hip and trendy and have money, then they'll still go for the same advertising.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 I think there's a lot of voice recognition.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well, now the voice recognition, if it works wonderfully, we could possibly deal with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet because people are just so used to buttons and, yeah, it's kind of safe.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think we need safer. So, we need both.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 So, the voice recognition would be just an extra. It wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 What I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say, I want to watch it one instead of saying that I want to go on channel number 45.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, if something like that can be incorporated.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, if that was in the voice recognition, that would be great.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important because, I mean, sky advertised on every channel.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, then it would be watching charm and then the sky added for it. Come on, and it would change the sky.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, and that would be really annoying.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 But that's definitely it. But on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 You probably might just speak into it and the TV would be already farther away.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, it might not pick up the other things coming from the...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 Do you not think that defeats the objects of having voice recognition on a remote control?

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, that you can yell at it.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the surface and something can yell at it.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's changing, you can look for it later.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but then the remote control, I think, I mean, the idea is kind of, it's not that it's sitting there on top of the television because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't need the remote control.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, the remote control is still something you keep near yourself.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I suppose near it to you.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_04
 Like, if you have some downtown, then...

0:32:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 So, the remote control being...

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 No, but I was just defending the fact why we want to keep the remote control close to us and not to yell at it from the distance.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the TV.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 You can go and press that button and the remote control wherever it is, it will be.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_01
 But then if you're buying the remote separately, but you could have something that you could stick on to the TV or something.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 Right, yeah.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_01
 If you bought it in a two-part pack, so one part attaches to the TV.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because it's quite important that you don't lose the bit to locate the remote control.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's right.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 But it solves the problem of having different noises.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, definitely.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I think we're going to have to wrap this up.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 But if we go away with that kind of general specification in mind that we're looking at 15 to 35-year-olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the button so it's easy to use.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 But only those key buttons.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 The major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 But that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarization, which you'll get immediately by email.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then we've got a lunch break.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 And after lunch, we go back to our own little stations and have 30 minutes more work.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it so that you know.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 It should be on your desktop.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll put them there as soon as I've written that.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_01
 Did you find it?

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 And email them round.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so you want our PowerPoint presentations and that?

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would be great.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll just put them there.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to email them.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 But is everyone's called functional requirements?

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 They're all called something slightly different.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Technical requirements.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 So that's good.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_01
 So if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 So as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever that means.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I'll find out.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_02
 You'll be looking at the user interface.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 Something conceptual.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_01
 Something conceptual.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_01
 And you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition or form of the math or something that will keep our up to go.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 And I was supposed to look into components.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 But the next meeting, are we going to have it right after lunch or shall we prepare?

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 We have after lunch, we have 30 minutes to prepare.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 But before lunch, we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, right on time.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So you can, I guess we'll see you for lunch.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_02
 See you.
