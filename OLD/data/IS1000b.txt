0:00:00	None
 Yes, this one?

0:00:07	None
 This light.

0:00:09	None
 Here are my slides.

0:00:12	None
 For participants.

0:00:14	None
 Yeah, exactly.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:18	None
 I'm going to come on.

0:00:22	None
 You're doing something?

0:00:24	None
 Oh, good.

0:00:26	None
 I had the camera in this case.

0:00:28	None
 You should have it easier to write.

0:00:32	None
 I'll put it in.

0:00:36	None
 I'll put it in.

0:00:40	None
 Okay, I didn't get it.

0:00:44	None
 It's good.

0:00:47	None
 You have me.

0:00:50	None
 I just saved it.

0:01:00	None
 It's for the radius.

0:01:03	None
 I need it.

0:01:18	None
 You have to save my camera.

0:01:32	None
 I'll just open it.

0:01:36	None
 You can switch it.

0:01:39	None
 Yes.

0:01:43	None
 I'll just open it.

0:01:52	None
 I'll start off.

0:01:57	None
 Okay, you.

0:02:02	None
 Okay.

0:02:06	None
 Okay.

0:02:19	None
 Okay.

0:02:40	None
 Okay.

0:03:01	None
 Is it on the runway?

0:03:15	None
 Yes.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, I see everybody's here.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 What's the agenda for this meeting?

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 I will present the agenda with slides to you.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see here.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 Perfect.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, first, just to mention, I will take notes of this meeting, and I'll try to work them out and give them to you.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'll make notes of the previous meeting, and I was about to send them to you, but then I had to go to this meeting, so you will get them too.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 You are the secretary.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 Indeed.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 I will have worked out some presentations about the task given to you in the previous meeting.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 In a minute, we will start with them.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 We will see which order.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 We will handle them off. Then I will bring in some new requirements.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 I got from the account manager. I tried to work them out. They were quite abstract, and we can have maybe have come from discussion about it.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 About the functions. Well, in this meeting, we should really try to reach the decision about the target group and the functionality of the...

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 You mean the social target group?

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I mean, well...

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Who are we going to get?

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 The customers.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 The customers.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 Indeed. Yes.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's important.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 Great question.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, and then we will close this meeting, and after this meeting, we will have a lunch.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe...

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 Why Anna, do you have a press tape?

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 You don't have a press tape?

0:05:57	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 No?

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 You are not able to...

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 I can talk about it, but I have no slides.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Maybe you can just talk about it, or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I have just been presented with some research we have done in a small focus group, so 100 people just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they wanted in remote control.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably got email as to you.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 I have just got a webpage with some data on it.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 80% of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 75% of users said they zap a lot, so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 50% of users say that they only use 10% of the buttons.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 So they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality, but really most of the time they only use a small part of that.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have this information on the webpage?

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 I have a webpage, yes.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can send an email to me later.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yep, sure.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 About this.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions that are remote control.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 Power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 Channel selection is used 168 times.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then there's things like channel settings, audio settings, which are only used very infrequently.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Kelly Texas used 14 times in the hour, so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that 50% of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, I have to.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 So my location in the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 34% said it takes too long to learn to use the remote control that once it's easier to use straight away more intuitive, perhaps.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_00
 Easy to learn or do you say?

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 34% said it took too much time to learn to use new one.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_02
 And 26% said remote controls are bad but RSI. I don't know how we just got about one comment in that.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 What did you do?

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 For RSI, are you prepared to destroy an injury?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think that our doctor says that it's the opinion of the user.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what the report says.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 And then it's got a demographic breakdown.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_00
 You cannot put this webpage online on the...

0:09:05	SPEAKER_02
 I should be able to actually. If I'm out of here now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 You can disconnect it then.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 You can maybe just...

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. It's a webpage on C.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's a file. Okay.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise you...

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 You can connect this one.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 You can connect this one.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 What do you have?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 It is.

0:09:22	None
 Okay.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for...

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, they took a background with us.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably easier if you put on yours than the amount to you.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 This is a web link.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 These numbers have to be taken into account for both user interface and functional design.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 One thing it goes on to talk about, which is interesting, is the...

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to constrain our design based on what is more important.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 One thing that's interesting is talking about speech recognition in a row of control.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Speech recognition in?

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful?

0:10:29	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have no thought on that?

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just get this up.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 So they would not need any button?

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Or potentially, yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 Or based on speech.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think even for...

0:10:44	SPEAKER_02
 Interesting idea.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think that would not work so well.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 You wouldn't have both options.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it would be a solution for when your remote control is lost.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, when it has speech recognition, then...

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 Then it doesn't matter where it is.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it should be in range.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe it can respond and produce sound, so say where it is.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 But these are all quite fancy futures.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure whether...

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 We can make this for 12 euro, 15 cents.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 No, you can't.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 And we don't know where the state of the earth of speech recognition is.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe, you know...

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it depends.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 There is a very small vocabulary where you want to do the operations.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 Like, you want to say, on, off, one, two...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 But it's quite noisy.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 You're doing the TV.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not going to be so easy, but...

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Usually, it's going to be more of an isolated...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have some more?

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's 25 cents.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, just to summarize maybe the...

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control, who would pay more for it.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 90% of the 15 to 25 year old market said that they would pay more.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 It goes down from there, 76% for 25 to 35, 35 to 45, 22% for 45 to 55, and then 8% for 55 to 65.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Big glare.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 It really depends where we're going to be targeting this product, which we'll be talking about later, I think.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we will talk about this later.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Did you get the email?

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that one.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Just follow that link.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 It'll be in a different window.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 Left.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, perfect.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's the biggest I was just talking about there, with the different demographics.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 Another thing that's talking about there is the LCD screen, but there's no figures apparently on that.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe, can you give your presentation now?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 I stay.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 No, you can move.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 You can move.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 I can move as far as...

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I take your chair.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, you can take my chair.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's a tenor solution.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 How much is that?

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's actually good.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think, as everybody knows, I'm the industrial designer.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 And in this presentation, this quick presentation, is going to focus on the working design of the product.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 And I'd like first to give a quick, simple introduction.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 How does it work so that everybody knows, even if you don't have a very technical background, or is it, I think, in the project is important.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically, the basic function of the country is to send messages to another system that is fixed.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 And so an energy source fits an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually through infrared bits.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 And the user interface controls the chip, and accordingly the messages.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 So, my method for designing the work design, first, the main point is that I would wish to make a really functional product.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 I would prefer to have very functional capabilities, whether than fancy stuff that, in fact, is not used and doesn't work.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, for that, yeah, it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing expert, Anna.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 And we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control, and I'll show you the working design.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically, here is a very large view of what we want, on a button.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 It can be simple, but it's important.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 And also enabling the two broad channels, as well as other buttons that come after.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, the components I quickly draw here is that in this part you have the remote control, the sender, and the other part, the receiver.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's my method is, well, my aim would be to design the, and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 So, of course, we need energy sources and other receiver.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 This is a very quick design.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_00
 You stop me or interrupt me if you don't agree on it on that.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, what I found, after a lot of work, actually, I draw for you this schema that can be maybe too technical for you, but it's really important for me.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 You do it a long time ago.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well, I won't.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 And, see, so I won't go into details about that, but these are my preferences to use the kind of components.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 And why do you want this kind of component?

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 Are they cheap or are they reliable?

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 What were your...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, the main components you see here are the cheapest I found and you have always a compromise with reliability and it's expensive, but these ones are also really reliable.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, that's it for the working design.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 I hope you get clear view on what a remote control is in terms of technical components, but maybe, yeah.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's more clear now, I think.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 But is it... can you just buy it on the market and plug it in or you want to...

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no, this is a preference, but we can always change.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 What I was thinking about, the schema about the sender and the receiver, can you get back to it?

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, the receiver is, of course, already in the television and we are not able to change it.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, yeah.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 We must adapt to the receiver.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose there is a standard way of communicating to the television.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 We need to adapt to that protocol that already exists, but what we can do is adapting the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bowls.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's just you have to change the frequencies.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 The frequencies? Yeah.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, in the chip you have...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 But you should be careful people are something becoming a problem like a guy has recently designed a remote with a switch off any other TVs.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So basically it goes through all the things, so maybe you should think of...

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, yeah, we should take that into account.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 Just take the TV in the next apartment through the lab.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 So you can just tell us...

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 Just watch the seat and then switch off everyone's TV and you can just walk away.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to be near the TV at all.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 I like that idea.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think Miles will consider this thing.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can go to your presentation.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I assume we were finished.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 So I can take my...

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 I can take mine. It's OK.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I...

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 I know where this...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's on a desktop. It's a technical...

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, OK.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 That's all.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's all. So... I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 So what...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it's about what is the user going to do?

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think Miles has presented what is going inside.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 So what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he's going to use it?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the approach is that...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, the idea is to send a message to the TV set.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 As Miles has pointed, and it will be decoded by the TV.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 And usually, we... it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then...

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 Changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the TV.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 And basically, it sends an infinite signal and decoded by the receiver.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 So... as... Anna has said that these people are interested in things which are...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 You don't need to press the keys.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 People can have a speech recognition, but this is a question which we have to see later.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your phone.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it sends a message to the TV.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. And...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 Generally, I don't have some figures, sorry, but...

0:22:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, so you have a standard TV remote where you have just an on-off button and play...

0:22:40	SPEAKER_03
 Volume change and...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 Keys for the number and more than one digit option.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_03
 And if you see, for example, right now...

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Even the one... more than one digit option is for two digit... which is like 99.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 But tomorrow you might have 150 channels, you know, to browse or 200 channels to browse.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 Who knows? But... then there is a...

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 This is a standard one without any fancy thing, you know, like...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't have to let text option. It can... without any...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very simple thing... which you can browse.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then you have a... what's the... video remote... which is like...

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Usually it has almost all the keys over there, but then it has other options like...

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Stop... and then you play the movie or...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or fast forward the movie or something like that.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 So... it has those... so these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_03
 market. And then... which is generally used by the people.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 And then... well, personal preferences, I would...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 Basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where we could have both...

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 The... TV and the remote... video remote control, because...

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the keys in the videos remote control and the TV...

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 They could be integrated together so that we could...

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Aim for the... like in the coming future...

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 The type of... applications.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. How would that work? So I've got...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 Say maybe a VCR and a TU which is separate.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 So on my one at home, I've got a VCR remote which then changes the channel on the VCR...

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. And then the journey on the TV.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So is there gonna be like a switch on the remote that says...

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 Use a TV or use a VCR or does it know which one you want to use?

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, you could think of having...

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
 You can have a key which could tell... it could go to the video thing.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 But... you still can't... in that case, when you use that, the function should be able to take up the VCR option and you could play it all.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 You can also think about having like...

0:25:09	SPEAKER_03
 In a few days, you will be in a few coming years.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 You might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box...

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 And you have something like...

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 You don't... you suppose you are not able to watch some program and actually...

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
 It downloading all the time for you and you can just...

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 You know, when you come back, you can just switch on that thing and watch the program.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 In that case, you want to browse fast or browse slow.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 You want to have those kind of functionalities.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 This is a kind of next generation thing.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 But it is going to come in a couple of years.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's already there. I mean, the blog is recorded.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 I've seen them in the show.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So it's going to record your things and you...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 You need basically the functionalities, what you need in both the...

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 Video as well as in the standard TV thing.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't think we are trying to make a universal remote here.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 No, we are not making a universal remote.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_03
 We are just looking at giving a scenario.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 I have a TV and tomorrow I am going to have a setup box which is going to sit there and...

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to do that for me.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 We need to decide on how far we go to in this...

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, can go pretty far, I think, with functions and possible future...

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 But it's good to keep in mind.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So that ends my presentation.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we can always discuss about it.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the video market actually...

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 This demand, video over demand or what we call it as...

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's presently booming up actually.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 So people are providing things like...

0:26:57	SPEAKER_03
 Movies you can select actually.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to watch a movie and your provider gives a list of movies.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_03
 And then you select those lists.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_03
 And it basically you go out, it downloads a movie, it gives for you.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 And then when you come, you want to watch it on your TV.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 This is going to be...

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Or even you don't need to download it streamed online.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it can be streamed online for you.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 And you can say what time I want to watch.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 So I have received some points of thinking over of my account manager.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 And I would like to share them with you.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 First thing is teletext is a well-known feature of televisions.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 But it's getting used less and less.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 That's especially because of the internet of course.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 So we should think about it.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Do we include it?

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 And do we give it a prominent place on the remote module control itself?

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 As Anna indicated, it's not used very much, but it is still used.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 So do we stay to the television only?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 The television as we all know it with broadcasting signals and you can't go back.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices?

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 So David is in BCS?

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 Indeed.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 And the hardest recorders.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 Furthermore, we need to really interest younger customers.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 And then with younger customers, I mean people below the age of 40.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 And how current customers are mainly 40 plus.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 So it is a market, but they will grow older and they always need to have the future with younger people.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Therefore, younger people like friendly designs.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we should make our city as friendly as possible, but it should also be a reliable image.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_01
 So when it looks too spacey or too fancy, people will think, well does it work at all?

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 You know, if you take it, you have like 0, 1, 2, 3, like keys separately.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 But suppose if you take the present end of mobile phones, there are like big thick keys.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 You press on the top, it takes one number, you press on the bottom, you take another number.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 So the space covered, so you don't see two separate keys there actually.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it is like, maybe you can draw it on the board.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 Especially if we're going after a younger market.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_00
 That's already used to that.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 The new and the funky things.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, there's lots of very pretty mobile phones, not too many pretty remote controls.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 And they're skilled by using it.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 So for example, for example, you have a key like 1, 2, 3 like this.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 And you can have keys like this form like that.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 Because you have to have a demographic at all, that's a very important issue.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 So you can have keys like, which are like, so, sorry.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 So you basically don't change the original order of them.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 But then the keys are more spacious, they don't look, so there is a very slight thing.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 So if you press on the top, it takes the 1, it takes the 3, 4, sorry, 4 here, 5 or 6.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 So the keys can be, it looks, you know, not very much cluttered.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 But it looks nice.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have too many keys, but you can have a lot of options.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 I think now the idea is clear.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 We should now try to decide on our direct group.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, which I think is quite tricky.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 Basically we're trying to get people to buy remote control.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 Wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one?

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 Of course they have already one.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 So our remote control has to be better.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not going to have more functionality because it's only a low market, it's a cheap end or a control. We can't beat them on functionality.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 We might be able to beat them on the look of it, the design of it.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_02
 But that's not a big seller.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 If they're not going to just go and buy a new remote control, just because it looks pretty.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 They have to actually need it as well.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think many people said in your research the appearance of the RC is important when they're buying one.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_02
 But why are they buying one in the first place?

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 Indeed.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 So that will be about functionality.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 But if people are buying new remote control for functionality, they'll buy a universe remote.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 I've got friends who have got so many things they need a universe remote, otherwise they're using five different modes of their older things.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 In that case they wouldn't buy our product because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 So you think we should go for a more universal type of thing?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we can't with the price range.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 We're not building a universe remote, we're not building a high-end product.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 But we will think about what we're buying.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have 12.5 euros per RC.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 And I think with this, now you know the chips are very cheap.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 And we can include it in our control some new features.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_02
 If we're getting into universal remote territory, we're getting to LCD screens and things like that, which would drive the cost up a lot.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether that's necessary.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think the university is necessary.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think this could be a market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 And quite complicated to use.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we can try to go in between and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's flexible maybe.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 But still people have the idea that this is more functional than a normal universal RC because it has more...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's some kind of universal.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're going for the say 15 to 25 age group, then not many that would actually own TVs to use the remote control on.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we're targeting I think more on the 20 to 40 group.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 So people would just have or already have a job and have the money, but may not want to spend that much money on a universal.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know really what the price range rate control is.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going to be at the very bottom of the price range or are we kind of middle to bottom?

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think when we think it over I think we are trying to offer the kind of universal control for less money.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 So do you agree?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's fine with me.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_03
 Like the price as long as it is not too expensive.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because we have to take into account that we're going to sell around 4 million.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 So when we speak about these numbers, the price of a cheap is very cheap.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm okay for designing less, a kind of universal RC.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 You think it's possible for the 12, your 50?

0:36:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 So then we decide on going to this more universal kind of control.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's what we need and basically that's needed right now.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's needed.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_02
 Basically you can look through the standard.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_02
 And you've found together market really needed that.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess what I'd like for my university remote is maybe choosing between three devices, being able to switch between them, maybe stereo, VCR and TV.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_02
 And just be able to use them all from the same remote, but not at the same time.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 You can also browse through all the standards, you know.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 There are the limited standards for all of them and you can just browse through them.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 So given we are going for this universal type, maybe it's good when you try to find out and you definitely need it and you will try to get more specific user interface consent.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe you can look on what trends are in this type of market.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 So anyone has a point to bring in or shall we?

0:37:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I don't have anything right now.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 We'll go and we'll be sure we'll come up with something good for you.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, we can have plans now.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, so we'll meet in the next meeting.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 We'll often learn to do a few things.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_01
 We have 30 minutes of work and then we'll have the next meeting.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 But you will inform fire at the computer.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Perfect.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_00
 We'll do it.

0:38:54	None
 Okay.
