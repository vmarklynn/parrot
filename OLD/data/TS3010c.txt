0:00:00	None
 I'm assuming.

0:00:15	None
 Okay, let's use my, state onwards the input.

0:00:37	None
 The statue is black, just bling.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, let's start.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 What are you doing?

0:00:57	None
 Up.

0:00:59	None
 Ah, pinball.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:01	None
 We're not doing.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 I have my screen back too.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 We have presentations.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, first, it's your turn.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 Mine.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, great.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's amazing.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 Very interesting.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 Industrial designer interface concept.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, well, let's talk about the interface concept.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_04
 First, I'll discuss the buttons.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_04
 We just show you some samples, discuss some colors and design, maybe, already, and my personal preferences.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we chose the power button to switch the television on and off, the mute button, to switch the volume on and off.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 The channel buttons, one to nine, and zero to nine, and the button to choose higher channels than nine.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_04
 The volume and channel quadrant left and right, up and down arrows to the volume and channel.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 And the menu button to manipulate the LCD display.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_04
 I found some interesting samples.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what's pretty standard is that they're all pretty high.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_04
 Large, yeah, large, and pretty thin and long.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 Power buttons are mostly at the top, left or right.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 We see the same arrows, like there.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, arrow buttons can be blue.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_04
 And what's interesting is the icons on the buttons.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_04
 Some buttons have icons, like the play and stop, but we don't use that.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_04
 We have to choose the right icons or letters.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 This is the V for volume, but they're both a V.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not very clear what's the function of that.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so that's...

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Can you go back one page?

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 For the menu, what do we use for that?

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have buttons for the menu.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 Or we have to use the volume and channel quadrant.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I thought that was our idea.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so...

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 You have to put it on the...

0:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 Like this, or this.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 That the menu button is okay.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's to be clear that you can use the arrows.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_04
 So the icons on the arrows as well.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's a second one.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's something to think about.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, maybe I'll have something in my presentation.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I can see it.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't know if we have to discuss this already or in the next meeting, but as we have to design the case and the whole remote control in our corporate company colors and logo, I would recommend the yellow case around the edges, the logo at the bottom.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_04
 And, well, maybe it's a set of buttons as its own color, so it's good recognizable.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think...

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 Not too much colors.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 No, not too much, but not flower power.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, but it has to be trendy and...

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so good icons on the buttons and big buttons is my personal opinion.

0:05:55	None
 Okay.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 That was that.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, you're next.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'm next, okay.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 Here we go.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 First, we will say something about what younger people want, our group, we want to sell our remote control soon.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 First, the younger people, they want like soft materials and primary colors, like totally yellow, totally red.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's visible.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 The shapes are curved and round, like you also said.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's nice to get remote control, not like all the other ones, straight and flat and long, but to give him a shape of your hand so it's easier to use or something like that.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 But that's just an idea.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'll have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_00
 The battery, there are a few options.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think the best option is to use the basic battery so everybody can buy it at the supermarket.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Or use a kinetic battery, like within a watch, when you shake it a few times, it's loaded.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 The form of the remote control, I think it's also nice to have it curved and maybe like it's hand shaped.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 So, you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 Material, you use plastic, hard plastic, because it won't have to burst in one time.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 And also rubber, because the younger people like that, what we see in the research.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_00
 The push buttons, we have one new thing discovered.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's a scroll push thing like a mouse.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's easy to use for the channels.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 When you want to go move up, you just scroll up and click on the button if you want to see the next channel.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 And also for the mouse, for the volume, it's also easy to use.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_00
 Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 And that's also easy, just when you have a thing like this and you get it here.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 You can do it with your thumb.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_00
 If you're left hand, you can push the buttons, if you push channel one, you can see channel one.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 The electrics with scroll push button, we must use regular chips.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 There are also simple chips, they are cheaper.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 But then we have just a basic remote control.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 And I think there are a lot of those things and people won't buy it anymore.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 They have seen enough of it.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 And you have also advanced chips, but that's with the LCD screen.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 And the costs will increase a lot more.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 And I think our budget is too low to use an LCD and the chip is more expensive.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe it's also thoughtful if we use different kind of shapes for the remote control that we then use the primary colors.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 Like you get a yellow remote control, red one, blue one, etc.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 You have any more questions about this?

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 I think the main thing is when you look at the costs and not the basic remote control, everybody already has.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 This is with an LCD?

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Not with an LCD.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 There's this easy when you use the scroll buttons.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 You can scroll, you see what number, then you push.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 But then what I say, the costs will get a lot higher.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 But then it's not easy to use scroll, will.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Then you'll see it on the television.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but then you go one down one up.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but when you see a menu on the television, it's like you see one to twenty, you go scroll up.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 Like we said before, it has to be used on every television.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 So you may not be the television misduded.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think the younger people will have newer televisions which can provide our remote control.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Younger people have them on their room.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 And mostly they are smaller.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, so, but that will be a problem.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think most of the times that are not as fun as televisions.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 But then we'll get to the regular remote controls and I think what I said, everybody has them already.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 And they go to a supermarket and buy them for two euros and get the most cheapest thing.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we must look further to develop something new.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 Can you give an indication in the cost difference between the chip with LCD or without?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 I got it on the screen and it was higher, but I don't know how much higher.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think if we have an LCD, it will also sell a lot better.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 And that might bring back the cost.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 But then we'll, I think, we must discuss what will be better if we have a better shape of the remote control or better options on it.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 With a scroll menu, a scroll thing and an LCD and then a flat remote control or a more hand-shaped remote control.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 With a scroll without LCD.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can look how much it is.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 I can look on my LCD.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 Very important.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_05
 There we go.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 Now that the push button requires a simple chip, a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 The display requires a advance chip, which in turn is more expensive than a regular chip.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 More expensive, but how much?

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's from my manufacturing.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 Deficient.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, thank you.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 So, so my presentation is about trend watching.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 I did some trend watching. It's very important to keep up with latest trends, because if you don't, you won't sell.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, I will do that.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we made an investigation of the market by trend watches.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_03
 They watch it in cities like Paris and Milan, of course well known for their trend.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 And well, what did you find?

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 We have two groups, young and 20, and the old and rich, and young and 20.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 They starting to like food and vegetables as a team for clothes, shoes, and also products.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 And material, the chute feel as a pointy feeling.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 And you get a feeling for what this is, and with an image of it.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 Then the old and rich, they like dark colors and simple, nice blue shapes.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 And they also like familiar material, especially wood.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 Another picture.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 You get a feeling for this.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then already come to my personal preferences.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 We aim at the younger market, so we should also be a look at their trends.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 However, with trends, it's always, it's now, in my last one year, and next year, it can be totally different.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we want to sell our products for longer than one year.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, we must not just only look at the product trend is now, as it might be totally different next year.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's one thing to keep in mind.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 Changing covers.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 Any questions?

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:09	None
 It's clear.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, no.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 Now, we have to decide.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have to decide on the concepts.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have to look at the next components, and use the interface concept.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Now, we have to make some concepts. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 First, use the interface.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 How we make it?

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, a concept.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 Sure, we first discuss about what...

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well...

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Something like this, or shapes, or what do we need?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Can make some concepts.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, okay.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 We have to have some idea in shape of your end.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 More like something.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 I can't draw with.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 I have to.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not a designer.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 I have 3D like...

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 This is the remote control.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then you'll have something like this under it.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's easier to get it like this.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a gun.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's to be soft.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_00
 And it has to be soft, yeah.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, you can squeeze in buttons.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons on top of it.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 And here, the scrolling.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can do it with your thumb.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 But that's the only scroll button on it.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Now, we use one scroll button, and the other one is here, one till...

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 Zero till nine.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but one for the sound and one for the channel.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 Or two buttons.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, if you go to...

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 If we use one, then we'll have just switch on it.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 You'll just switch it.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 And now it's the sound switch back.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's more difficult.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 If you have a menu, how do we use other options?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 With the menu button.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then you also can scroll in it.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 But like all the other ones with this thing and here and arrow, here and arrow, here and arrow, here and arrow.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because from 100 remote controls, 99 half it.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 But if we don't have LCD, we don't have a menu.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have it on the TV menu.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 But again, maybe...

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 How do we know that TV can handle it?

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 You don't know.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 So there's no menu.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's like some sort of a teletext option, but we don't have teletext.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can't use it.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 And if we put an LCD thing on it, then the costs will paint much higher.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we make two concepts.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 One with LCD, one without LCD.

0:20:17	None
 Okay.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 But you all like this kind of thing.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 Good concept.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 With the scroll button.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 And this one has to be soft.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 And this has to be harder because when it falls, it must not burst.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 Or some kind of rubber around it.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 One, two.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 Number two.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 You can make the power button as a trigger.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 That's nice.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 Trigger.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's one way or two.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 I put it on and off.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Not good to use.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 How's that?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Fucking out.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not good.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, second concept.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 One with LCD, one without LCD.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Then a...

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 Paint it.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 Paint it.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_00
 With the scroll thing on...

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 One with two scroll buttons and one without...

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 One without...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 With a menu and one without a menu.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 And one with...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 With a menu as an LCD.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 Draw it.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 Unbelievable.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 Do I have to do everything?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 Blank.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 I have...

0:22:50	None
 Not so difficult.

0:22:53	None
 But if you push the menu button...

0:22:56	None
 Or this menu...

0:22:58	None
 Yeah, they have the LCD screen.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but you don't know which of the...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's called buttons you have to choose.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 You have to...

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 For the menu.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 One...

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 That way and one...

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 That way.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 Then it depends on the coast.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 On and off.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_00
 But is it easy to use when you're on your left side?

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 When it's not too big.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 Just like a phone.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's better if the scroll wheels are...

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Separate, more separated.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 Like you have the menu built in between the...

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, on the left...

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll button and on the right the scroll button.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 But what it would be easy to use then, if it's like...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_00
 You have a big...

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's better.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 When you are on the menu you have to go...

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_00
 They were like round curves.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay. That's the outside.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 But now the first buttons.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 You have now two buttons missing the mute button.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 You have to use missing the mute button and...

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 You have to...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Mute and the other.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 Not so difficult.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Personally I think two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 But how do you want to solve it?

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 With the switch button.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but in the menu that's not easy.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 No, like down.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 You switch, you go into the right, you switch, you go down.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 All you mean like that?

0:26:12	SPEAKER_00
 Then you can also have like...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Joystick.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and joystick thing.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 But this is just a break.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 Joystick.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Or a small one just like in a laptop.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 Like in a laptop.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 Some sort of thing.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 A little bit bigger.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 I mean it's better.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 But how expensive is it?

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Why do I pay for it?

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well...

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Better, I'd ease.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 Or no scroll.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's just a shape.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 Young people's I think scroll buttons good.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think we have to keep them.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 Or a remote control more like joystick.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's not expensive then that joystick is better.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 A small one.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 Like this like in a Nintendo.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, just like in a playstation thing.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 A laptop.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 Small round.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 Then it's not so big.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean the shape of the remote control.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a playstation.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then you can...

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 You have to use it with one hand.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe if it's possible, it's not too expensive.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think joystick is better.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 A small one.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 So, please look at it.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_02
 And on the LCD, how much it's got?

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's close to extra.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 They're not in details.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's more expensive or less expensive.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think you get it.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 And after going with it.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 I got my personal cash.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know the costs.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 You're a problem.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not mine.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll make something up.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, do we have other concepts?

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 Then for the component, we use a normal battery.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 Then, yeah.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_00
 Or the kinetic.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 No, no battery.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's more expensive.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, we use a normal battery.

0:29:44	None
 Yeah.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Chip depends on the LCD.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 It depends on the scroll.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 If we use a scroll, then we have the regular chip.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 And if you use the LCD, we have the most expensive.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, it depends on the screen.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_00
 If we...

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 Now, okay, scroll, we also have this.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, it will be the advanced chip or the regular chip.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, the shapes of the design.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 It depends on the LCD.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 But it has to be small.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing and then just put also LCD on it?

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 If you have pistol, and LCD is not easy.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 You should use your thumb.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but if you use your thumb.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 I use my thumb.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 But then you have it.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 If you have pistol, you have to sell.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 And the screen is...

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 If you have a joystick on...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 Keep it this way to look at the screen.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 If you have like a...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 A PlayStation game controller.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 And you move up, forward, down, left.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 Then you have just a little bit curved.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's not just a...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's how we're using.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 That's why they make joysticks like that.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but then you look forward and then you can...

0:31:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Now, if you have to look at it...

0:31:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_00
 You know how to design it.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 We have something standing here with the LCD.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 Then it goes like this.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 No, why not?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's for the younger people.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, of course.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's something new.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 It may not break.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 Then we put rubber around it.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 Is this possible?

0:32:19	SPEAKER_00
 Hard plastic, the shape, and around it, around it's rubber, and the hand shape is also rubber.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 Or you can turn it inside.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 But the each of...

0:32:35	SPEAKER_03
 The each of you wasn't the most important aspect of it.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 No, that's true.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_03
 For which it's about to sell it.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 This is something new.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 Then this is the design and the buttons are on the next page.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 So it depends on the cost.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Close it, okay.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 We have one minute.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 No, more.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_01
 More.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:33:09	None
 Still 10.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 Next meeting.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 Thirty minutes.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, very up.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, that's us together.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 You two stay here.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 Pained it.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 Now you have to.

0:33:24	None
 So...

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's clear.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Check your mail.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:33:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it has to be ready.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 Next meeting.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, cooking.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 Next meeting is called the detailed design.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 Everything has to be ready.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for your attention.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thirty-five.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_03
 Three over the next meeting.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:34:11	None
 Five minutes to finish.

0:34:15	None
 Couple now.

0:34:18	None
 Oh, there's two batteries in the laptop.

0:34:22	None
 Two?

0:34:23	None
 Nice.

0:34:24	None
 Five seconds.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 Both in front, I think.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_05
 Hmm?

0:34:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:34:33	None
 Okay.

0:34:35	None
 I'll leave.

0:34:38	None
 Okay.

0:34:43	None
 Okay.

0:34:45	None
 Good luck.

0:34:48	None
 I think you're right.

0:34:51	None
 The little key.

0:34:52	None
 Note.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 Done.

0:34:58	None
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

0:35:01	None
 Okay.

0:35:04	None
 I don't know, I don't know.

0:35:09	None
 Safe.

0:35:11	None
 No.

0:35:12	None
 In this room, big English...

0:35:15	None
 That's naughty.

0:35:17	None
 We speak some sort of de-elect.

0:35:20	None
 Okay, it's got Dutch.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be ready, in thirty minutes.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 See you for play.

0:35:29	None
 All right.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_05
 Oh.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, you bet please.
