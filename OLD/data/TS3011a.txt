0:00:00	None
 Good morning.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_01
 Marketing experts.

0:00:18	None
 All right.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_01
 Are you ready?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 You should put the laptop right into the square for the cameras.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 Mr. P.M.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 How are you today?

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 I'm fine.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_02
 How was your business trip to Boston?

0:00:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, I didn't go.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't feel like it.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want to open it as read-only?

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I should close it here.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 You have the same message of Windows connection?

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we will have a tip that I would like to play.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, stand by and close the window.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. The waiting is for our marketing expert.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_00
 Root.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 Project kick-off.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a schedule for this meeting?

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, there is, actually.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 I will... this is the agenda for today, for this meeting.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning, Root.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's important.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 Shall I close the door?

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, great.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square for the cameras.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 We're here to develop a new product.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the first meeting to generate some ideas about it.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 You are here in a specific role.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 Root is here as the marketing expert.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 Root is here as the user interface designer, and Sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Is that correct?

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's correct.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan, and we will have a discussion.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 This meeting should take no more than 25 minutes, so we should keep that in mind.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 Is there any room for a little presentation?

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe during the discussion session?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 There is.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there is.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 No problem.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, this new product we are going to develop.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's remote control, a television remote control.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, it should be original, it should be trendy and user friendly.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 Those are kind of easy goals.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm sure we can find more goals for the product we are going to develop.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 We will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it should function.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 All those kind of things.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 The market, we should have a look at the market.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to use a project method during this development, which consists of three different design stages.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 The functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 All of these stages mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then meet to discuss the programming.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 The progressions.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 The first stage, the functional design.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to search for the user requirements and we will make a specification of that.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 The second is the technical functional design.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 What effect should the remote have?

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, in this case, control the television, I think.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 The last one is the working design. How exactly does it work in the technical sense?

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 The other design stages, we will discuss that later.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 We will keep it with the functional design.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 Before we think about remote control, we will work with some of the tools we have here.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 As you see now, I can give a presentation.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 It is also possible to use this one as well. You can display two presentations as you want to.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 To present it, to show us a file, you will need to place it in your project documents folder, which is on your desktop.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have this electronic whiteboard system.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_00
 I will show that now.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can draw on the board using this pen.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 There are little sensors.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Do not grab it here, but a little bit more to the end.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 It is on the eraser now. We click the pen button.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 Not too fast writing.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can insert a new slide or whiteboard file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_00
 All our smartboard notes should be kept in the same file.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 Do not make a new file. Just use this one during the day.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 You can use the eraser to make something go away.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 You can use the same whiteboard file.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 We can work together on it while we are going to only use it in the meetings.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 In the meetings, only in the meetings. It is really like the regular whiteboard.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 You can choose the format.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Let me see.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 I guess it is maybe because I am not pen selected.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 Current color. You can choose another color.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 You can choose the line width.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 Now I have a different line width and a color.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 It is quite easy if you do have any questions.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 I wrote down the documents.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 It should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 As a little training, I will ask Root first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different color and a different line width than the one now selected.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 It is a funny rabbit.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 A rabbit.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Could you do the same?

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 Sebastian is thinking about the animal.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 It is a cat.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 It should be a cat.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 It should be a cat.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 I am guessing a horse.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 With a very small legs.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 I guess you get the idea.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Back to our project.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control we are going to develop.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 We will have a selling price of about 25 euros.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 This product is 50 million euros.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 The product will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 The production costs should not be more than 12 euros 50.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 We should keep that in mind during the development because those are important numbers.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Then the discussion may be the time for Sebastian to show his presentation.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_02
 There might be some.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 First, my role of the industrial designer.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to think about the implementation of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 If someone comes up with ideas, I will try to translate them in technical functions.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 There might be some impossibilities.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 I will propose some implementations for that.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 I will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 I have some initial ideas about some things which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_02
 One thing about interoperability.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think modern remote control shoots control a diverse subset of equipment.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 For instance, DVD player, cell phones, video and audio equipment.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 One remote control for all your equipment.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 For cell phone?

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 There should be some interoperability between them.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think it can come in handy.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 We should discuss that.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 We should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 We are not living in the 1980s anymore.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 You should think about Bluetooth.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 The infrared is a little old-fashioned.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 But all the fees are equipped with infrared.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 You cannot know.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 That is the most of them.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 That is something we should discuss about everybody should think about it.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 That is just my role.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 I will give you some technical input.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 Take these things into account when you start the discussion.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 The main point you are telling us is focus on the interoperability.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 One remote control shoots control one or more pieces of equipment.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 The way of communicating with these equipment.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 That was your presentation.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 I will go back to my own presentation.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 I do think it is time now to discuss some things.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implications.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 There are other things like how to make it trendy, which is, I think, most routes role.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 The way how it should be controlled by the user, which is a rule during this part.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 Let us start with you.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 How do you think the remote should function for the user?

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 A few things in mind.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 The remote should work on different TVs or different devices.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 It is a universal remote control for customers to buy a store.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 It is not for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to business to consumer.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 We are not developing this product for a specific vendor.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 We are developing this product and we want to set it to a very broad public.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 You should fit to every device.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 Do you agree?

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 The technical function, like what you said, is just by pressing the button.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 You should change the state of the TV.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 That is just the basic technical function.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 That is my part for this session.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Is that ease of use?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 The technical function is pure.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 What should the remote control do?

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 What is his task?

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 It just should change the TV's state.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 You see the buttons as a means of doing this.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you want a touchscreen.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 I have seen these remote controls with this little stick, which you can move forward.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 It is very easy for a user to switch between channels or between tracks on a CD or on a DFT player.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that is an idea.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 For other user interface, I had more industrial point to get a DFT.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 It is quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the DFT.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 You must point it everywhere.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe not even point it.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 In that case, infrared should be a restriction to that.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 It is a restriction for the operating range too.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 When you are not able to point at the device, the range is fairly important.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 For TV, you are always in the neighborhood of a TV.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think the range should be a problem to that.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to get it working with a radio and you are in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be a...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, gentlemen.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Just to remind you, we have five minutes left for this meeting.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 Two more things.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 You are able to feel the buttons without...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 You have to know what you do without looking at the buttons.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 It should be a user interface for feeling.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 It should be good to understand.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 You must use the buttons for volume or whatever.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, you don't always know where all buttons are.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 It should be visible in dark too.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Those are two really user interface.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 I will write down glow in the dark.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's perfect.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to hear Ruth's input for this meeting.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have anything already idea about how the market will respond to such a product or what we should take in account when developing such a product?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think most things have already been said like control multiple devices.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 And infrared might be an issue because...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, he said about pointing, but lots of devices already use infrared.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 We'll probably have to implement that.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Sebastian, did you have any other ideas?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yes, I had about three minutes ago.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 I seem to forget them.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 I forgot them.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yes, I remember.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 You said something about visibility in dark.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 Would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control on which you can see functions which makes it easier to operate this?

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, maybe I...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 It can be quite simple.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_03
 You can just have white buttons with black mark on it.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_03
 The digits in black, then it's already visible in dark.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 So it don't have to be lightning or fancy.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it can be for design.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, because we want to develop a trendy product.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 So there's a cost limitation too.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Twelve year or fifty.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, yes.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 A big problem, I think.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be high end product.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 The cost price is very low.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Just remind something.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 The digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Always have the soft buttons always clear the paint on it.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 The mark.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I have one point which comes in mind now.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily, or should not consume too much power.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every other week.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we could, for example, only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 Or, yeah, I don't know.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 That's more, Sebastian's.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 But then Bluetooth might be a problem.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think Bluetooth uses a lot of...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 I know cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it seems to work quite okay.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 But you can use Bluetooth all the time, 24 hours a day.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 Gentlemen.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's over.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm afraid we do not have any more time.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we will go back to our own work.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 And well, you know your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 So, this was it.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 See you in 30 minutes.

0:24:49	None
 Okay.
