0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 to do now is decide how to fulfill what your stuff is.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of does make sense, isn't it?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because when we get into the end of meeting, we're kind of talking about action and design, as opposed to background.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_01
 Everything I have is kind of background.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_05
 OK, we're all ready to do.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_05
 We'll have it in this meeting then.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_05
 If we just recap on the minutes from the last meeting, we decided on our target group being 15 to 35.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_05
 We decided that it was going to be normally chargeable battery power, that we're going to group our audio, visual, and other functions into those categories.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything, accept the TV, and trying to incorporate the corporate color and slogan.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_05
 Start with the last meeting.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_05
 Is there anything?

0:01:01	SPEAKER_05
 Have I forgotten anything?

0:01:03	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_05
 So everything.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_05
 So if we have these three presentations, and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're going to want to discuss, maybe just make a note of it, and then we'll have all the discussion at the end.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 I want you to have your idea this time.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 And so if we start off with Angie and then Craig, and then David, is that all right?

0:01:25	SPEAKER_05
 And then after that we'll have to make some decisions.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_05
 I've got stuff.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_05
 Get that.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_05
 Take this.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_05
 Screening quick, take it away.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_05
 How did we leave it with speech recognition?

0:01:50	SPEAKER_05
 No, we should say we're going to try maybe incorporate, but we hadn't made a definite decision on that.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_05
 We should also point out that the final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_05
 So that's kind of the end result, hopefully.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 So does it function F8?

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's working.

0:02:22	None
 Oh, no, we're good.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_01
 OK, great.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_01
 So we just start this.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_01
 OK, great.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 So let's move on.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, where did it all go?

0:02:32	None
 It's not good.

0:02:33	None
 OK.

0:02:34	None
 OK.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_01
 So let's move on.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, where did it all go?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's not good.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 Let me just see where I find it.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 Is it one like it?

0:02:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think I just opened up the template.

0:02:50	None
 So we know that.

0:02:51	None
 OK.

0:02:52	None
 All right.

0:02:53	None
 So let's have a look here.

0:02:54	None
 OK.

0:02:55	None
 So this was the method that I've taken.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_01
 Basically what I want to do here.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to do that.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to do that.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to do that.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so this is the method that I've taken.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 Basically what I want to do here, before we get into it too far, I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 And then sort of go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information and then sort of bring us all together into it to see how this fits in with the overall vision.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarize it for us.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 And then identify trends that are sort of in sync and are important to our project plan that we have so far.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 And then initiate a kind of discussion on design options.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 So that sort of helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other elements of the project.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 Does that make sense?

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 That sort of strategy.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that's why I suggest we get in.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so out of different figures and ratings of people in general, consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that the television remote control of a fancy-looking feel, OK, and not specified, not a functional look or feel.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_01
 Fancy.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 However, this is where we kind of have to be very, I think, creative about it.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Number two was that it be innovative.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary sort of functional bits to it.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_01
 And third priority for ease of use.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 So again, that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be quite user-friendly while still having technology.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing is that I think what we should think about is how the, about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 For example, like when you pick it up and push it, like it all lights up or something, you know what I mean?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_01
 So how do you make innovation make something more easy to use?

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's, I guess, where we're going to go with this.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 OK, then there's the other aspect of the back of the market research I have here is on fashion style, which, as we've agreed is a priority.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 Top European fashion trend that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetable.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 OK, especially in clothes and furniture.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 And when I first saw that I thought, well, do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it?

0:05:52	SPEAKER_01
 Or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it?

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 OK, OK.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 My feeling is that we do want to observe this trend, but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think what we're in, what we're in is partly sort of home decor, partly something like a computer.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we might want to be careful about how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something. I think that would be pushing it.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of, I might say ergonomic or friendly to handle, which is, which also indicated that last year this was, this was not the case.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 So probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode. So if we try and really capitalize on that, I think that'll be in our favor.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the summary of everything.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Style is number one thing in the market of who we're selling to.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Innovative design technology is also a must in that it seemed to be seem to be cutting edge.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 But ease of use has to be ensured throughout. That was like the number three thing.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then then there are vibrant natural colors.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's the way I interpreted it anyway. Softness and material shape and function.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 And so I wrote and written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 Mac iPods. Something which is, I'd have to say very high tech. Ten gigabytes, whatever.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_01
 But when you hold it in your hand, there's like no buttons.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 You know what a Mac has changed?

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it's more of like a more of like a comfortable type of, or more of like a maybe more vibrant friendly thing to have.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then so this is with all that information, what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas and as we get into more the more.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Like sort of production side of things that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go throughout sort of like.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know like we think of some kind of a theme that unifies it all that we agree on sort of like a marketing identity.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 Does that make sense? Yeah.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 So, so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kind of get us thinking along those lines like lemon line, I don't know, green colors, whatever just ideas I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their, what people associate them with in terms of texture shape colors, things like that.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 Like the ones, the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like lemon or something like that, you know, something which is like you see a lot in other areas like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon line.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, anyway, just just an idea. I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly into something which is, which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like, like something to do with like lighting within it.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you know, just this in the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button, it lights up.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Usually the buttons light up. How can we build on that? Maybe like it could light up in different colors or something or people could buy the by the control and then it comes with different like covers or something.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, that's all I have, but hopefully we can revisit those ideas when we get into.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you for that.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_05
 Craig, do you want to plug yours in?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably not sending.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, something coming out.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, little bit of concept.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 To research it, I have a company, the homepage again, it's providing me with more examples of previous existing control controls.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 There's a wee bit of discussion about the existing ones there.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'm taking the suggestions from them and try to incorporate them into this.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 And the side of the control and the buttons, the shape of the control and wherever the button should be located on the control.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 I found from the research is that most of the current controls are just basically bricks with loads of buttons all over them.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 They're not very attractive to look at and they're not very comfortable to hold.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 They're just holding big bricks and they're very even lost.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 They tend to be very dark colors so if they're shadowed places, they're in the catches, you can't really see them.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 The controls themselves tend to use a very consistent color scheme.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, the standby button isn't almost red, it really should be.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's something that the user then identify with.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 They say red switch off, that's how it should be.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 So from that, I've got a couple of preferences for the end control.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Again, with the red color button for standby and the other examples of that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 The button should be large, they should be tiny little things like heat and some mobile phones, they should be easy to prep, very comfortable.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 One of the examples given on the home beach was there's an up and down volume button, both of them have a B on them.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button, not as confusing.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 It should avoid things like that.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 If the corporate color scheme allows it, we should have a very bright color so that it can be identified anywhere.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, it's trying to avoid being tacky there, but it could be timed very easily with your alignment.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have a corporate color scheme?

0:13:14	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's yellow because the website is yellow and there's the band at the bottom.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_05
 The playdough's yellow.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_05
 Definitely food for the not there, but keep going and we'll discuss it.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 Any extra features we add, the only basic ones should be hidden.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 They shouldn't be on the, should be visible without something to be opened or special or extra effort.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 If we do decide to go for a voice activation, the show will be about the alternative, possibly hidden in there, the open top section.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 In case something was wrong with it, I can use voice to be a bit of cold.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 We should definitely avoid the big square block book.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's just wrong.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 We've got an email from the research department.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 They've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask a question.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 It could be good to have them confirm any action you take.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know where the spoken cue go.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's fashion and dealt funnings.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know how to explore the color scheme.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 You can see you want the corporate colors, but you don't see if you can use any other colors at all.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 Great.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 Lots of good information there.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_05
 That was very good.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 I know it would be handy, wouldn't it?

0:15:08	SPEAKER_05
 Oops.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to sit in the line of sight of this?

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 Let me just get this.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 There it is.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 I guess the same thing again.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 I started with something very basic.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Then you can just work through it and either modify it or start from scratch, depending on what your needs are.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 The components are exactly the same.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think like what you guys said, the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 The rest of the components, they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like you said, time to market was a problem.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 And how many components are physically in their cost?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the power is basically a factor of that.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 And the lower components of the power, the logic, the transmitter, and the infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 And that would have some impact on how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we said, we've defined like we only want the basic things that to be visible in the rest of them.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 We try to hide.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, it's just a matter of working out space.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess three things.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 Cost, complexity, and the size.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 These are the three things that will have an impact on you.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 So just go through the components.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 These are the options that are available to you.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not very sure about the voice thing because I got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 It said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 It said something about a sensor, but it never clarified that.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe if you could see the other email that they sent you because they got back to me in a different requirement.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 Or different offerings of what components are available.

0:17:38	None
 Okay.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 So your basic components are buttons.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 And you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 There's an LCD display.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think these are quite standard things.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 They're standard, I think.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, in a sense, these are all the options available for you.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 I explained to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 Then there's how the case actually looks.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 It can actually be flat or it can be curved.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 And then the different types of materials that you can use.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think you can use them in a combination, but I could check back for you, but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_05
 You can have like plastic rubber.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic rubber and wood.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 I wasn't.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not very sure about the titanium.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 The rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 So I think that there is some restriction on.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 Wood and titanium, but you know, it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 You know, as opposed to two.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the other components are logic chips.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Again, I'll go back to the component chips.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 How complex or how easy the logic is.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 It depends on how many functions you have on the unit.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 And that impacts cost.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think the logic chip has an issue about size because they should be about the same size.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 Power consumption should be about the same.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think the main impact is complexity.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing is the power options.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 The first one is the standard battery.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 The second one, I think, is more of a gimmick than actually a usable thing.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's a wind up.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 You know, a crank.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 Just by moving.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 But that might be something I think that's more of a look and field decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think whatever this you still need a battery because I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 The other ones are a solar power cell, which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons because half the year you've been dead.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 So like what I said, you probably need like a battery and something else.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_02
 And the kinetic one, I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fit over there.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 And it's a nice sales gimmick, I think, from a marketing gimmick.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's a technology thing.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's a shaker.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't shake it, knock it or something.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you know, you have those balls, you know, those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it lights up and it goes, you know, that might be a gimmick combined with rubber.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 You know, just to, if you get frustrated with remote control, you can throw it kind of, you know, just the, you know, so, okay, my, from my role, I don't think there are personal preferences, but role preferences, I think something comfortable to hold.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Small and slim, I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable, not so small, you can't, you know, like a phone or too small phone. And the other thing is from a production point of view, the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 And also the time to market and the complexity of developing, designing and debugging it.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay, let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons are standard.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the LCD panel and the scroll wheel, you need more complicated logic.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 The case, okay, with a rubber case, you can't have the solar panels.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, with the titanium case, let me just check that.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium case can't be curved, it has to be square.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, there's no restriction on the plastic.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 It can't be curved.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 It can't be curved on the wood.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 So that's, again, I don't think you can use them in a combination.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, especially the titanium, I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 So mixing them may not be a good idea.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 Question on, can I ask question?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, well, yeah, just quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, can we power a light in this?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can we get a strong and a battery to power a light?

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think we could, because the LCD panel requires power and the LCD is a form of a light.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_05
 Why, what kind of light do you want?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, I'm thinking it might be that for this to be a high tech thing, it's going to have to have something high tech about it.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to take battery power and to make that, to make that a realistic goal.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think one of the issues that will come up later is a battery power.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Are you thinking of a light in the sense of light light or a light in the sense of a low kind of Frankenstein?

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm thinking along the lines of you, you're in the dark watching a DVD and you, you find the thing in the dark and you go like this.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 And that's what everybody does.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Always the volume button in the dark.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 And you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something like a phone.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like a backlight.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas with phones, people charge them once a week.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I think the option of the, the kinetic thing, which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch, like an on the watch.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 But if people are going to want to shake their movie control, it's probably sensitive enough when you fill it.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 So you could trigger that to a light, like I said, the bouncing ball thing or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to, so when they pick it up right.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 And then that sort of triggers.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_05
 Well, let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_05
 And it's keeping an idea on the time we've got about 15 minutes to play with at most.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_05
 So, um, yeah.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 So just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an absolute decision on the, the concepts of the product.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_05
 So back to your idea about, um, incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate color and things like that.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_05
 Um, I mean, what does anybody think about?

0:24:21	SPEAKER_05
 Does anybody have any ideas about how we can fit all that in together?

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's kind of the user interface type of thing.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 What are your thoughts on that?

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think I'm a corporate.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 Um, maybe not our, our fruit ship, the, uh, very sort of curvy type ship, then you can have this intra-textual and color as stuff.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe do it, are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably or sit you tooled on to comfortably or?

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Um, possibly sitting in your hand comfortably.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 So something quite curvy.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 Um, right.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_05
 Color wise.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, you, it was a year.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_05
 I can't remember who made the point about how if you have a nice bright color, you're not losing it.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_05
 Is that?

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 What's that mean?

0:25:01	SPEAKER_05
 About how if you have a bright color, you'll not lose it so much.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_05
 Um, and when the corporate color is yellow, I mean, maybe we can think about, about the color of the whole product being yellow, I don't know.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_05
 Um, and then obviously the, uh, the materials, but as anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what, what might work.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 And if we think that what we are, our number one marketing motive is, um, the look and feel.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sort of bits and bits and pieces of, of concept and technology or whatever, or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sort of can visualize.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Um, maybe what we could do is think about a concept which touches back to the color, you said company color, yellow.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if we think of something like, I was saying also lime and lemon, you know, what can we come up with something where we, we try and associate it with, with like the series.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 We just come up with something like that.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 We kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a particular shape that you're interested in like, this marketing, how many research on, does it need to be long, does it need to be a square thing?

0:26:28	SPEAKER_02
 And I think circular and shape or, yeah, because that will help narrow down the choice of,

0:26:33	SPEAKER_05
 choice of material. I was kind of thinking about as well, you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones and they're plastic but they also have like rubber around the outside that kind of feels, it feels kind of warmer to the touch, feels a bit more comfortable.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe it could incorporate plastic on rubber and to it and then we could have carb shapes because we're titanium yet it's going to have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that, you know.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_05
 So, do we want it in like the shape of a lemon or?

0:27:07	SPEAKER_05
 No, no.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't think we do.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's more, more just that we, we think about like, what it is we're trying to achieve and then we have one, one sort of theme that we stick with.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 Right, well, so thoughts about the actual shape is a thing.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 I'm quite like a sort of snowman type shape.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_05
 A snowman shape.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 And so, sort of larger bits it's new hands.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then you've got the yellow, the top, or just any other thing you need.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_05
 That's quite a distinctive shape that we go with.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah, should we go with that?

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Can we, yeah, like, to any, like, do you have a...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to draw it on the board?

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just, we can visualize it.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_00
 You've got two groups there.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you could fold up and you got a third group inside.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 That'd be good.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 You have one which was about there.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_05
 So, call that the snowman shape, trademark.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 That's cool.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 And, I mean, color wise, which is everything.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, do you want the whole thing yellow?

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want something?

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's quite nice if you just add this around here.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_00
 They start background yellow and then have a nice bold color for the buttons.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_05
 Cool.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_05
 And also, I mean, how are we going to incorporate this lugan in?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 The fact that it talks to you, I mean, it might be quite cool if when you first start using it, it says, what is it putting fashion into electronics or something?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_05
 Or when you, like, turn it off or something.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_05
 If it can speak, if you could actually say this lugan, it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_05
 And any thoughts on that at all?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think that probably scare me.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Turn on your...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_05
 I know.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_05
 Unless, I mean, if you, also, like, were, if we wanted to incorporate an LCD display, where would you put that?

0:29:29	SPEAKER_05
 Will you put that on the inside?

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need an LCD display?

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 What's the functionality of that?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_05
 It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the question is, what are we using it? What would we achieve from it?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 Putting in lights is cheap, but putting in LCD panels just to make it glow is a bit...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 When you mentioned LCD, I think that would be about...

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 And the thing I could see it helping with the...

0:29:51	SPEAKER_01
 If it was somehow connected with listings.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 So as you scroll through, because we said we might have a jog dial, as you scroll through your stations, you can...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 It actually tells you what it is.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 So it's a bit nuts to get the user there.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 One day, Tuesday, Wednesday.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 So no need for an LCD display?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not saying there's no need for an LCD display, but it's...

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 What would it tell the user because the LCD tends to be an output as opposed to an input?

0:30:22	SPEAKER_02
 So there's a remote control need to talk back to the user.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 We have the option of the speaker as well.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 The same thing goes for the speaker. Is there a need for a remote controller?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_05
 Why don't I... There is really...

0:30:36	SPEAKER_05
 Talk back.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 I would say no need for a talk back. Does anybody disagree with that?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 We could put a game on it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Easy.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 When the TV dies, you can play with the remote control.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_05
 Right, so you're going to have these three different sets of functionalities.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, do you want to group them into head of the snowman, and the body of the snowman inside of the snowman? Is that what you're thinking?

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think the advanced ones, the ones you don't usually use can be head inside.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think they're the three groups we had, where we're pretty basic ones.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 They'd have to go on there, they're fun somewhere.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay. Right.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_05
 What else do you need to talk about?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, where would you physically position the buttons?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think that has some impact on many things.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you want to draw into that.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm just going to pop this in here because I have a slide about decision making.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yep.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_05
 I'll try to figure out the word.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, go on, we've got five words.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_05
 Back again.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_05
 Energy.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think that's suggesting we're hard-pouring the thing?

0:32:01	SPEAKER_05
 I really like the idea of this kinetic thing, where you'd have the backup of the battery, but have kinetic power.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 I've had kinetic things before, and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, like I said, we have that.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_02
 Watch is hybrid kind of thing, so it's not going to charge the battery.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's just...

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's just worth pointing out because I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time, and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_01
 I've also known people to have things like a jewelry watch they wear from time to time, and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Remote control is similar.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Your way on vacation, I don't know.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 Something...

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 And it just starts to get worn down.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_05
 Let's face that, if you're away and you're not using it, then you're not using any power either.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_05
 So you'd have the battery as to kind of keep it ticking over idea.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_05
 I'm really sorry we're going to have to wrap up quite quickly.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know as much time as I thought.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_05
 So I think that's what energy is referring to here.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_05
 Chip on print.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_05
 Is that an industrial design thing?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_05
 As for the case, kind of discuss that.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 And this size here, I'd suggest this be small.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_05
 And we're going to have rubber buttons that feel kind of...

0:33:23	None
 Okay.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 Just a lot of...

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, one of the things running through my mind right now, I realize we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 But we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons, plastic frame.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user-friendly theme?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 Like what is it that we're using to achieve those goals?

0:33:57	SPEAKER_05
 I think that backlighting the buttons and stuff like that.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 Or even a clear case.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 A glowing yellow type case where the yellow showable, but in the dark, it's sort of...

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 It's a light.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's slightly transparent.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_05
 So it's yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see threads out there.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_02
 Or there might be a light running through it like a mouse.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you have colors nice and they don't need that much power.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 So the battery in that sense, where you have one or two strategically placed lights.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 That sort of...

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they emanate a light through it.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but because the case is transparent, so it gives it a little bit of a glow.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 That's a make it freaky.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 And then the other thing that we've committed ourselves achieving is simplicity.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 And so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's the main thing people just want to do.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice just sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it?

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 When you're rolling it, how do you want to roll it? Do you want them to roll it like that? Do you want them to roll it like that?

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Because in a mouse, your hands in a position to roll it.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas the other thing about having a jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_02
 Why don't we do it like a mouse?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_05
 You could do that, couldn't you? If you're holding it in your hand.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a very unnatural motion to... Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot?

0:35:31	SPEAKER_02
 We might work for volume and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 But not for channels, right? If you have a tele-west box, you don't have to buy all the channels. You can go out to 50 channels.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 You can imagine trying to... Okay.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think having that too quick, too slow, it's confusing to the...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 For skipping watch, you have to skip the channel button.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_02
 And users tend to want to use that and once they lose out and then use the experience, it becomes the most accessible thing.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 But that's not a bad thing, is it?

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you think about it, the alternative is to push the button.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Jog dials are much easier than that.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a job dial in nice and quickly.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_05
 I'm all for them, actually. I think they're quite unique, very quick to use.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_05
 So, does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design at all? No.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 And the other thing was, can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing?

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Like, I mean, if we keep coming back to this board here, I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 Imagine that, I don't know, that it's within the shape of the hand, it's quite small.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_05
 Ooh, okay. We really got to wrap up.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's small, and that we've got the slogan somewhere on the casing, the side.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. What if we can do that, great?

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, isn't that what we just said we just have to decide now?

0:37:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_05
 Let's try and get the slogan on there.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then I can just spend the shape of the...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 And then like a jog dial, somewhere that fits in with the shape of it.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like, I don't know, like here.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 That might have one problem in terms of...

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 You never get bumped.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of whether you're left-handed or you're right-handed, you might be locking yourself in.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe just fitting in like down the middle here.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just jump in and suggest something to the audience?

0:37:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'm really going to have to hurry on here because we're actually over time.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's kind of...

0:37:31	SPEAKER_05
 Is there anything anybody's unsure about?

0:37:33	SPEAKER_05
 Just for enclosing, just the next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes, and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are going to hopefully be doing.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_05
 And I know that the designers are going to be working and playing out on that.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_05
 So that'll be good.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I'll get the minutes as soon as possible.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_05
 Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to?

0:37:54	SPEAKER_05
 Everybody kind of happy about what they're going to be doing?

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think one thing would be the jog dial because that's going to have quite a big impact on the thing.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think the jog does.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 You know, just after you do that, what if it was flat and you just...

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 That would be great.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_02
 A slide.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_02
 Because then you don't have to put the hand.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think incorporating the logo is quite straightforward.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 There's lots of space for it.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of a design thing that you guys can discuss.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 But it's also a marketing and a function.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_01
 And materials we sort of said we do plastic and rubber, didn't we?

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 And I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons because that'll just be so standard.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_05
 Do we have something flush with the case?

0:38:30	SPEAKER_05
 Something a bit more flush.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_01
 And also plastic I've seen can get really textured.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 You can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hands.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's kidding.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 You can feel kind of like...

0:38:45	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_01
 You get balloons now and then you'd think that they were rubber but they're not.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 They're actually just plastic that's textured.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of a little bit on that.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to have to call this to your clothes because we're away every time.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_05
 So that's really good.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_05
 Like we've had so much to talk about that pretty much run out of time to do so.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_05
 So what do you do?

0:39:05	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to have to do some design stuff.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_05
 Play it all down.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:39:12	None
 Quite jealous actually.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_02
 You got to choose first.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_02
 No, we're kidding.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just swipe your power cable?

0:39:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it matters.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's you.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_02
 This is real.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_02
 It has all the...

0:39:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oops.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to take the microphones because it's too lazy to take them off again.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.
