0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome back. Hello. Let me see. There's one of mine.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 The waiting is for Sebastian. There he is.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 We have a flight problem. I opened the CD-ROM box.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 You can't. Sorry.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 During my work I have no time either.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is live. Sorry, Edel.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I opened the CD-ROM box.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. People, welcome back with the second meeting.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 For now, on the schedule are a few points.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, the opening, which we are doing now.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 Second, I received some new project requirements.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if you received them as well, but I will tell you about it.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 Then the three of you prepared a presentation, I think.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Sebastian? I think so too.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_02
 Ruh? Yeah.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 Ruh? Almost.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 Almost. Okay. Then we'll do your one last.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 Top goal of this.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 Your presentation from here, I believe.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_01
 We will figure that out.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 If as well as I can just... I don't think it's why.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 The top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product, on the target group, and the functions of the remote control.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 Keep that in mind.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 We have 40 minutes.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_01
 The new project requirements.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, we didn't speak about it, but we should not support data text in the remote, because our board feels that data text is out of date, and Internet is replacing data text.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 So we are not even going to try to implement it in our product.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's a board decision.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 Remote control should only be used for television, because it's not feasible.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 We cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 The third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than 40, which is important for you, Ruh, and as well for Ruh, because the product should be interesting and should be bought.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 It should be bought by people younger than 40.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then for Ruh, as well, important.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 The corporate image should be recognizable in our product.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 So the colors and the slogan do have to be in the product.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 Is that clear?

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 Any questions on these requirements?

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 The individual presentations.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 Ruh, or Sebastian, who would you like to start?

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'll start.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 Jeez, this one.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we discussed already in the previous discussion.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 The function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 The main important thing, what a remote control should do.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 I found two different kind of remote controls.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 The multi-function remote control with many possibilities, but the lack of the feeling I already mentioned in the previous discussion.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_03
 And the ease of use remote control with less possibilities, but a great feeling in touching the buttons.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 My personal preference is the ease of use remote control, because the user-friendliness can be more trendy in user design.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 But your new goal was for people less than 40 years old.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe the multi-function can be implemented in our design.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 But it should be a combination, but teletext buttons are not in our design.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 So it should take out eight buttons or so.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 But in my opinion, the ease to use RC is the best possibility for us.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 Rude, did you get that?

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, most.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the important thing here is-

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it's also indeed a good insight in the topic.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 In the market.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. What does the market want? I don't know.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Just for user-friendliness, I should choose for the ease of use remote control.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 Question.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 Excuse me.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 And still the right thing.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there are some changes in the design requirements.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_03
 So there are some changes in the method also.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, all this device has to do is send messages to a TV set.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 And the most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I've tried to implement a picture here, but it's hardly readable.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 Can you see it?

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not visible.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there's an energy source here.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 And basically, it's connected to three things.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 A user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using infrared light, which are sent to the receiver.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 That's basically the idea.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_03
 And there's a little picture just for your imagination how a device like this should look or can look.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 What have I found?

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Usually, these kind of things consist of battery, infrared, diode, buttons, chips, and circuit boards.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's all.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 Let's case together.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing more than that.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's almost every piece of equipment.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 Every TV set is controlled infrared.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 There are some exceptions, but most of all have infrared controls.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 And the more luxury remote controls have little buttons.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that's a little bit more fancy also.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we should consider that.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 I have a basic scheme of the things which are implemented.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, this is all there is.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_03
 There are a few buttons connected.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 The buttons are lit.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 And the whole thing is transmitted by infrared light diode.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 And there's not a power source here.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's fairly easy.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's fairly easy.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's been done many times before.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should succeed in our plan to do this.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 Personally, I think we should use infrared because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every TV set.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 I think that should be clear.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 Another important point is we really should use energy sparse friendly components.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 There are specially designed energy friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 And if we want to use rechargeable design or energy safe design, we should really implement them.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 For cost effectiveness, we should really use a very low cost circuit board because most of the production costs are in this part of the equipment.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 And the money we save when using this, we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques, blinking lights and all that kind of fancy stuff.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_03
 I think our users will really like that.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 And if we use less, does it use much more energy?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 No, the power friendly less also.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we can use them.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 So that's no problem.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_03
 For the same costs, they're a little bit more expensive, but by making low cost circuit boards, we can make it, I think.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 You could only let the buttons that are used most.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 So the channel switching.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 But the question is whether two or four buttons makes a difference in the costs.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 If you already plan to include fancy lighting techniques, I guess.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's the same as in cell phone, just one light in the device that shines on all the buttons.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 But one light, there are more lights in there.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but not for each button.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, this should be it.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 Have a think about it.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, dude.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 Mine is already outdated.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we are very curious to what the market will feel about such a product.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Any income is welcome in PUT.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then I'm sure the target market is 10 million units, of which we should sell about 40% to make the 5 million.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 Could you just have a little bit more to the right?

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, since the other part is 40% of the market, I thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 But since the requirements changed, that's not a good idea.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, skip this.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_02
 But this is the truth, of course, that they only use temps and buttons.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons to zap are used about 1500 times when the power button is only used one time.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume button is only four times.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 So they're obviously the most important button.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 And lots of people complain that they can't find their remote control.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 So we might want to build in a feature to support them.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 Some audio signal like home phones.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's interesting.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 Finding function.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's definitely interesting.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 It separates our product from others as well.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, go on.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I just said that, and this is obvious, and he also said it.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that's what the market tells us.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 That's about it.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 The volume and the zap buttons are mostly used.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 The zap buttons most, they are used a lot, but more than the other buttons.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Just have a perfect design for those, only those buttons.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 First, we should focus on that, I guess.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the technical, I think there are no technical difficulties.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 There's no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't think we have any hiccups there.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 And the sound signal.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 And the sound signal.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 That's one thing I'm just wondering.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 The sound signal from where do you execute the sound?

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 The sound.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 None of the devices.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's the reason.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe you should be.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like clapping in your hands, like turning on and off the light.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe there are some devices who incorporate this technique already.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 There are video sets and there's a special button.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Find the remote control button.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 You press it and your TV set starts to make a kind of weird sound.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 And your remote controls then start beating.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 Report.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 And just like the phones.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 Same thing.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 But the fees don't have all.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 So we must shoot you something else.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 Because we do not have a home.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 We do not control the TV set.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 So even if the TV set would have such a button, you would have to walk to your TV.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 And we want it to make sure it's as easy as possible for our customers.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 So what about the clapping technique?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'm convinced Sebastian will find one solution for us.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite complicated.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds?

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you see it a lot in lightning.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, basically the characteristics, the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume, the amplitude, the sound, which is generated a few times within a certain period of time.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 But there are many other sounds, which are exactly the same from the point of view from a recording movie.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 It would constantly beep.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't want to have just a home station, a base station next to the TV.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 Just a little antenna or something, something like that.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if you love something more easily.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think people would bother walking to the TV and press that button.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 Because they lost their remote.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 The most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and perform some kind of humbling.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 And then the remote control reports itself.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 So we should use something like that.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 You do not want another device, which can be everywhere now, which you have to find first before you can find your remote control.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Just a base station next to the TV or something like that.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 But that will be very costly, I think.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not good.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe Sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with a solution.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's his field of expertise.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but before I do it, I want to warn you that by implementing this kind of a function, the technical design will become more complicated.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it will become more costly also.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Because there will be additional components which will be used.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 And there are some people even prefer the sound above the lathes.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think so, because when you have a newspaper over your remote control item, you cannot see it.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a distinction in the market.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's a different model.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's in a unique feature.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it's worth looking and probably more interesting than the light.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Just about the user interface, I come up with an easy remote control and advanced remote control.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 What should we choose in design?

0:18:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, according to Root, people do not use all the extra features very often.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 I have the numbers right here.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, we won't support teletext, which was the third most, the second most used function.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well, we do have a wise board, so I'm not questioning that.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, channel selection is obviously the most important.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so on the relevant scale, the channel selection, the volume selection and the teletext.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 So just the basic functions.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 And we don't have to use it for DVD players and all kinds of stuff.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 So that's out of the question.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 Just the easy.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should go for the easy.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 We can make a nice design when there are not much buttons in it.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 We should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions and the money that we can save from that.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 We should use for a recognized design and thinking about the user interface.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, Root, how do you feel about that?

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Do you agree that you think the market would respond to a simple?

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if we include other innovative functions, then they might.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can use young people like new features.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so this is kind of a...

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Just a few buttons, friendly design, nice, lightning effects.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe there's not a possibility.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can make it look like an easy piece of equipment, but it's quite elaborated because it has many functions.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's more important to make it look like a very friendly, easy to catch piece of equipment.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 But are we not in the manual?

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you have few buttons, no display.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I guess it's working with shift functions and one button can...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, like that.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 I was more thinking about the more elaborate way of controlling by these kinds of sticks or something like that.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if it's user friendly, that's your field of expertise.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but how does the remote report give back to the user in what state it is because we do not implement usage.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 But there's no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 I know, but if we use like a stick, for example, well, maybe we can use a light for that.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 When you move the stick to a position, maybe a light next to it can lit up.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 So you know, I've just pushed the button or changed the channel or tuned up the volume, something like that.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 And if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection, you would add them to most important functions.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 And we could have other buttons for the advanced functions.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of the stick, like many cell phones, just around...

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, draw them on board.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's already...

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, we have a blank.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, something like that.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's just an easy way of a round button which can be pushed in four directions.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of a stick, a stick is vulnerable when it's running down.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 It can break down.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 Just around the button should be the trick, I think.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 And there's also looks more fancy, I think.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 I think it will attract more...

0:22:19	SPEAKER_03
 I'm a public, I think, but you're remarketing that.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also quite easy to use, so it'll attract younger people because they're new.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 And it might attract older people because it's easy to use.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 Geez.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, volume and...

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'm up and down.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 The pen doesn't really do that's what I want.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's good.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but we're still in the question of putting in advanced options.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, the market is interested in some advanced new techniques.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 However, keeping it simple is important for the costs and all those kind of things.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 We need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user friendliness.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think our next step to look at is just that.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, I don't think it's...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 We have something to do, we can discuss it right now because no one of us has the information to discuss about that.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think...

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 We do have to decide this meeting.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 We need to have the user functions, the functions, decided, and our target audience.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, the teletext is just...

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want a list of functions? Do you want an explicit list which incorporates all functions available on a device?

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I do not want a full...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's not necessary to have a full list, but I want the kind of functions.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 For example, the most important are volume and program, selecting...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 The 10 digits?

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, for example, that's what we should think about.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 How is the remote going to look? Not in the user interface.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 The program to program button, it switches to channels.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 When you have something on channel 4 and something on channel 6, just one button which can...

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 A bit of a split note, like...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yes.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 Dual channel watch.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well, maybe I should write that down.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 You're the secretary.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Ruth, what's your last name?

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Mute.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Mute, because I was writing it down in the last...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 Mute, right.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder, so if you want to have a look at it, you know where to find it.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we'll make a sub-folder for it because it's starting to fail up already.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you want to do it, it's almost the end.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 Our BSCW hooroo.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 Volume, program, dual channel.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's important.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 And do we want...

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Ten digits?

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I believe so.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to go to channel 90 and you only have that button.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's complicated.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 But is that so relevant?

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 Because I don't think...

0:26:12	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't buy it personally if it were more controlled without the ten digits.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 I can imagine when all of you have a set-by-order and you have about 600 channels, I can imagine you want this.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 But if you're a regular TV user and you just want to watch the Dutch television networks, well, you can use about ten buttons.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 But we do have 13 different Dutch channels.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, a lot of people, how often do you watch all these channels?

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 They'll probably watch more channels than the older people.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you're probably right.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull, don't you think?

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it depends on the looks on the...

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, then there should be something specific.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 You can make them very fancy by...

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, Nokia.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 They have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 So I do not agree.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so you can experiment with shape or with size or with color.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly, exactly.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_02
 There are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 It might be expensive and hard to implement, but it would be a solution there.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, speech.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe it can be combined with the find-to-remote control.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_03
 So when you add speech recognition to your remote control, it's very easy to change the channel.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's one thing.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_03
 And it's very easy to find your remote control.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe that's a possibility, but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe when we... if we would drop the ten digits, but keep the program in the volume, because maybe people do not always want to use their voice.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 Especially other people don't like voice recognition, so we should implement such a both.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we do focus on younger people.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's a board decision.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think it should work.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 We should manage it yet.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 To make a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the voice recognition has the main advantage.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 It makes it very easy for us to implement the find-to-remote control button, remote control function.

0:28:48	None
 Okay.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's a big advantage, I think.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:53	None
 Good.

0:28:54	None
 Okay.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_03
 There's only one disadvantage by implementing this.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 The power saving, power saving will be a bit more difficult.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we can think something smart about it.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 There are some Hebrida hybrid devices, which incorporate the solar panel and rechargeable batteries.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 So when you just leave the device in a lightroom, it charges itself.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 But can we manage it for the cause?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, probably.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's like a very...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe, maybe not.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'll have to find that.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 And include a cradle in which it could recharge.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 So that wouldn't be a big problem.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's very cheap.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Is the cradle very cheap?

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's very cheap.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 There's no problem.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's just a case with two metal contacts.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 But there should be an adapter as well.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but their mass production, they're very cheap.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 It will cost us practically nothing.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_01
 We have about 10 minutes left this meeting.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to hear maybe you all have things not spoken about yet, but that are important.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 You came up with the voice recognition data.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 Are there other things about the market we should know?

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think we dealt with the most important information.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Just that the younger part of the market isn't the 40% we want to sell to.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 So we should, for at least a bit, look at all the people.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 But not like that.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 We should use, we might attract them to.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's a big problem.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 So although we are focusing on younger people to make it profitable.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_01
 Profitable.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Profitable.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 We still need to take into account the bit older people.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:30	None
 Ruh.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 I have nothing to add.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing to add.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose, yeah.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 I just want to make a summary of all things spoken.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 The different possibilities.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 So basically we've decided to implement a seemingly easy design.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 So on the outside it looks easy, but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 So those are the choices we have to make.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques and voice recognition, these kinds of things.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 It makes it also more attractable, I think, to our audience.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 There are some advantages and some disadvantages.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 And the main advantages that we can implement fancy techniques, which I think our customers will like, the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the costs and things like battery lifetime energy saving.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 Another advantage is that a circuit board will become much more easier if we do not implement these buttons.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 If we just add a chip, which does the voice recognition, our circuit board will become even more cheap.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 And that was the main issue, right?

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it was an issue, but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 And this even makes it more cheap.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
 But the cheaper the chip or the board, the fewer buttons you can use.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's the fewer buttons you have.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 The cheaper circuit board.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's the other way around.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it's very cheap to incorporate integrated circuits with chip.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not an issue.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 It shouldn't be a big issue.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Then we should just take a look at the costs.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 And because I don't know.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 Especially for the voice recognition.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 I really don't know.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 It can be costly, maybe not.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how I will determine the costs.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 I will have a look at it.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you will get some information on that.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how I will.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 I hope my personal coach will have a look at it.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, great.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we are quite done.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 For now we will have the lunch break.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 How nice.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how long the break will be.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 But we'll find out.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will have 30 minutes of time to perform our individual work.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm sure your personal coaches will assist you with it.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 I will put the minutes I just made in the project.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Documents folder if you want to look at it.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, just do.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_01
 The interface designer.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to, the next meeting, I would like to receive the components concept.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 Ruh.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 From you, I would like to see.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 User interface designer.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 Ruh.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to see the user interface concept.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 And the only problem is that it depends on the decisions the decisions Sebastian makes.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 About the four is what we said.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it should be easy.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we concluded.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 Just a volume and a program one.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, some fancy lights.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what we decided.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we dropped the first recognition?

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_01
 But it shouldn't be integrated.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course it's user interface.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 But I was talking about really the design of the.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, do we really have to decide now?

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 We can decide the next meeting.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 Because I'll have some updated info on that.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 I guess all of you have updated info.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure the marketing expert will receive that you will do some trend watching.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm sure the market will.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 We'll change, adapt.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 So we will see that.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's it for now.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 Any other questions or can we have the lunch?

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 We can have the lunch.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:36:19	None
 Okay.

0:36:48	None
 Okay.

0:36:54	None
 Okay.

0:37:02	None
 Okay.
