0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Hey guys.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_00
 Hi.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_00
 Hi.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_00
 I see my bunny is still standing.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 All enjoying it.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_00
 I figured I had that much.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to wake up.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_01
 A minute please, my laptop is there.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_01
 There it is.

0:00:32	None
 Thank you.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, welcome back at the functional design meeting.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 The plan is that each one of you, so not me, but only you, will present the things you worked on the last half hour.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 I will take minutes and we'll put the minutes that I have at the end of the session in the shared folder.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 Also, the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can read that now or afterwards.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_01
 I had an email from the management board.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you all also received it, but there were four points, which I think are very important.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 The first one is they think that teletext, teletext, becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_01
 The second one is also important because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 The remote controls should only be used for the television, so it's not going to be a multi-purpose remote control.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's one thing to keep in mind.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 Second, and I think that's important for the marketing expert.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 The current customers are in the age group of 40 years and older, but with this new remote, they would like to reach a group younger than 40.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 And a thing to keep in mind, but not really for now, is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognizable in the remote.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have 40 minutes, so I think not more than 10 minutes per presentation each.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 And please use all the facilities so that you have the smart boards, the word files, whatever you want.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_01
 So, Tim, can you start?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, welcome.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_03
 I have some new findings on marketing expert level, which I will show you.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 100 respondents were involved, and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 These were a couple of findings, first page of three.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 We have three audiences, of two audiences, I'm sorry.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 The first one, this skill of 16 to 45 years in age.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 The second one is from 46 to 65.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see here, the market share for the first audience is about 60%, 65.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 The second audience is 35%.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_03
 And some interest from the age groups.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff, like an LCD screen on the remote control speech recognition.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think that's really appropriate.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 And when you see the audience, the age is going up.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they don't really want it anymore.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 At least the new technology.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 The second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinions of the audience about current remote controls.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 First point is 75% of the users find the most remote controls very ugly, and 80% of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 So that's maybe something for the user interface.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Designing.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 Third findings, according to a frequency of use versus importance investigation.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 Following buttons are most important.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 I will tell something about the way this test was done.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_03
 The persons were asked what the buttons were.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 They used most, how much an hour.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 And in the second table, the importance of those buttons.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 When you multiply them, you get these three points.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 Switching channels.

0:06:49	None
 Yeah.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty normal.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's what you do with a remote control.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 The second, data text.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_03
 And the third, volume controls.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's good that we know what the user wants.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 At least these three points have to be very clear.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 But it's strange that the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 At the moment, data text is the best thing you can get on TV.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 Like getting information.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 So when you ask people what do they use, they use data text and not the internet or remote control.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 That's ridiculous.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's a new technology, but it's not incorporated right now.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 My personal preferences.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should aim at the audience from 16 to 45.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 First of all, it's the biggest share.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 The biggest audience.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 65%.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Second, I think you will get the most revenue from it.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, people from 16 to 45 watch a lot of TV more than people who are elder.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Second point.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 We have to improve the most used functions.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 As I said here, switching channels, data text and volume controls.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 Third point that came out of the questionnaire.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 People used to get lost of the remote control law.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's an idea for us to design a kind of placeholder.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 And sign off the TV where you can put the remote control in.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's about it.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_00
 We mentioned improving functions.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 What do you mean by that?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 Not the functions, but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 So you can have a remote control full of buttons, hundreds of buttons, but if you don't use them.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, focusing more on the use buttons.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 They have to be on it just to get it done if necessary.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 But the most used buttons have to be bigger or.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 For example, pressing it in longer makes it switch to a different function.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, perhaps.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 Just for the minor functions perhaps.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, perhaps.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Just not yet.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 Just to get less buttons on the remote control to make it easier and quicker to learn.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's it.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you, Tim.

0:10:09	None
 Yeah.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 Right. I'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project. Well, what I did was I dissected current remote controls and I viewed how they worked, what kind of components are involved and how they are connected together. And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organized and I'll show it to you in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why I think several possibilities that we discussed in an earlier meeting falls off. Right. Well, what I did was I checked the remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared like you probably know. And the thing about that is the remote controls have to access a TV or a stereo or something and those have transmitted that's also focused on infrared. So if we want to build a remote control with Bluetooth for instance, then the TV should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate. So that would mean extra cost for the user and that wouldn't mean a cheap remote control for us. So that's probably why most controls are still infrared.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 Firmware all have very simple structures that would probably mean lower cost and that could mean for us a good thing because we should be able to build a relatively cheap remote.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as I mentioned, radio waves and Bluetooth, well, it may be possible but I figured it wouldn't be possible within our budget but that's not for me to decide but that's maybe something for marketing to look into because my personal opinion is not to do Bluetooth

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 or radio waves although. What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or radio receiver in the place or next to the TV connected to the TV? Yeah, actually it's in our own product.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, I actually figured that would be rather nice but then you still have the infrared function so and very you actually just move the problem but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the couple is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote? If somebody says where is the remote then it goes BPP for something.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know maybe something to look into. I don't know what the cost for that something like that would be but it may be maybe something to explore. I'll just explain a bit of the components. First you have the energy source. The energy source would be a battery simple battery that you could find anywhere. I figured that would be best because when the battery stops functioning we could just use it, we could just go out and buy a new one so we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that. The energy source is connected to the infrared button but the infrared button works only via the chip and the sub-component to the switch. There is a switch between these. When the switch is pressed in, on this case the switch is a button. When the button is pushed in, the electric current goes through here and immediately a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened. The user won't be thinking, well, did the button be pressed? What happened? I pressed the button but nothing is happening on the TV so it's something wrong or something. So that's just to explain, make it clearer to the user. While the signal goes via chip that's translated into electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end and those interpreted by the device, well, in this case, television. Well, my personal preference is we have to keep it simple, not too many gadgets and functions. Just like you said, the most users, you have a lot of buttons and you usually don't use them. Why should we spend more time on those? I think we should stick with infrared transmitting and no receiving, so no input from the television. So I think we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and things like that because when you want teletext on infrared, you'd have to build a receiver too. So in order to receive the signals from what's on TV and such, so I figured that would be spending too much money and

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 time and maybe another problem. I think current TVs can even send. Yes, but should we, I agree

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 with you, but should we spend money and time on building a receiver into the remote control because that would be an extra component, extra design, larger remote control. These are all stuff that we have to take in account. So in my personal opinion, there's no receiver at all. Well, we should look into the design and the functionality. Like I said, use one button, for instance, for multiple functions or just hide a few buttons or switching it open or something. You use stuff. And don't overbuild. We shouldn't make big remote control for simple functions, but we should stick to the basics. So that was my personal opinion.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 And that was my presentation. Okay, thank you, Janice. Yes, I can go ahead.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 The last presentation, you have plenty of time. Tim and Janice, don't talk for 10 minutes.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 So take your time. If you take your time too long, I will eventually warn you. Well, I

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 am going to give a presentation about some of the technical functions of the design and usability function. What's my opinion about? What's most important to combine the design technical possibilities and the use of friendliness in one. So if you go into design, remote, that looks good, it shouldn't weigh over the, if it's possible to make, of course, but also use friendliness. So that's some of the main points. And another one is the use of many functions. Well, make it more difficult. So use as little functions as possible, or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote if you have 50 functions. You don't want 50 buttons to be shown at the same time. When you visit an internet, the size, you don't want 50 links to see, but maybe use a hierarchy structure. And one of the ideas was maybe use touchscreen, but I don't know how far it is possible since we have taken to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything. But we might consider that. Well, of course, I hope this is all clear to you. You can use a remote like this with all the functions and many functions, but well, your thumb is a little bigger than this. You have to be very careful what you push. And if you're looking for teletext, you'll be searching for half an hour from, well, where is it? Well, here I guess, when you have to use something else. So just keep simple, make clear buttons easy to use. For example, if you want to use a play and back and stop, that's very important. Well, this was because of our last discussion.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 If multiple machines are used, create easy switch between the machines, but it's no longer applying. Well, yeah, I prefer to use it only for TV. And not to give too many options.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 And if possible, the buttons should give a direct action. So first select. You just

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 had, you wanted to combine more functions in one. So you want to keep it simple. But I think that if you want to do that, then you can't escape the fact that there will be buttons which gives more options than one. Yes. But thing you have to wait against yourself

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 do we want to use a few options and might not be so original or multipurpose as we thought. Or do we want to use many buttons? And wing those factors. It's maybe an option if you

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 use an LCD or touch screen that in the middle are the main keys like displayed on the, yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that. Okay, just in the middle the general functions like play channel switching. Yeah. And then at the top or at the bottom some menus like settings

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 or that you can drop down. Yeah, another question I had, do we want to use a menu display on the TV or have to everything be in remote? If you use a memory display on the TV, you can simply push a menu and then select the options you want to have and press OK. So that's my recommendation. If you use many options in one button, display the menu on the TV and use combination of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times or five seconds is too complicated for most users. I think so too. And that's partly

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 because a lot of TVs have different menus and when you have a particular menu at your device, it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on TV. Yeah, that will be a

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 problem. Well, you have to keep in mind that several TVs don't even have a menu structure or they have a very simple menu structure. So you have to keep in mind that not all our remote won't be able to work on all televisions. Yes. And that would be a considerable problem.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 We have to stick with current technologies and well, the restrictions of what's on the market today. Yeah, you should keep it at this. Use big clear buttons, not too many. So maybe we'll lose a few options, but I think this is more important. Especially the important buttons. If you want to switch channel, change your volume, use teletext. It has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it somewhere away on the remote. It's behind something like a touchscreen or a good menu. Yeah, if you want to put the on standby or change the channel, that should always be possible to do not first change menu options or switch something. Well, yeah, as you already told, give some feedback. If the user is pushing a button, you should know if the television or at least remote is reacting and not just the batteries may be low. And well, my conclusion is less. It's more, keep it simple. So maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible because you all know if there are a lot of function on the television. Some you will never know and never use. And therefore, it's important if you want to change the volume or the channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important. Well, we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in a way for

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 the most important function. Yeah. I think the idea about touchscreen is very good. I think it's a good idea because recently I saw a news item on TV about new telephones for elder people. They have like a touchscreen with really big pictures on it, like a call hang up. And that's a big advantage, I think, because on the one end, you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something. It's very visual intended. What was I to say more? Maybe the snorps, keep the primary buttons

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 visible and make a remote that fits easily in the hand and for some design issues, well, put the logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form. But the important buttons make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touchscreen or if that's will become too difficult. Just like some older telephones, maybe it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible. Yeah, okay, but

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 if you picked the left idea, then what's going to be displayed on a touchscreen? The extra

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 function. The extra function. Yeah, but like menu from system functions or teletext functions and you just choose one and then all the options will become available and you just go through

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 them. Wouldn't it be better to just make one big touchscreen? Yeah, I want one small touchscreen and I'll just make let's say 15 buttons on it and where three of those are actually just menus with sub menus or sub items or functions. I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 big touchscreen, use the same concept as here. Keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touchscreen for the rest. Yeah, yeah, I like the iPod idea that we just saw.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 You just have a few selected buttons and a few menus and with this idea you could actually make several. You can also improve later on. Yes. I think that would be great. Okay, so you think it

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 will be better to have a kind of total touchscreen. Yeah, I would actually go. Okay, I agree but I

0:27:01	SPEAKER_02
 think it's very important that always make the same buttons accessible. So use just for special options with part of the touchscreen. Yeah, and so an aloe designer picks up the of an elder parent or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the system functions.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_02
 You have to have the possibility to turn off the TV or the switch channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary function. Yeah, I had another

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 idea about maybe parental control. Like building in some kind of pink code which allows parents to switch to all channels but children don't know the pink code. They can switch to violent

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 channels. That is possible. Well, that actually depends on the television but I think that would be just a simple login. Well, you see the thing is when you buy remote you set the channels. The channels are different on each television. They aren't certain preset order. So if you lock on a remote let's say channel 15, well channel 15 on this television is different than channel 15 on another thing. So that would be that would be actually the main concern. I think that he means that

0:28:31	SPEAKER_02
 maybe by some option make sure to remote control on a TV match and then after that you can use some inserts and passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this. Change the

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 settings of the TV like color and volume and that kind of stuff but maybe if you log in first as a barrel you address the channels and like oh this channel 15 that's a violent channel.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 My kids I don't want my kids to work. Yeah, they set the priority to only parents.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for example but make it a separate option in the menu. Yeah, okay but the late

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 former yeah that's just late here so that's another future. Okay, but let's not go too wide about those things. It's a nice idea but I think that's we'll later in the stage. I have one little question about a total touchscreen or a partial. Yeah, a partial because I think elderly people may be not used to a touchscreen so they want the normal functions like tailored sex, volume changing to be kind of traditional and the other functions, the more difficult functions, to be maybe on a touchscreen but to keep this as normal as possible to keep it accessible.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 But if you display it on LCD screen with really big numbers.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can display it on a new style.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 I do agree because it's just not the same when you touch a touchscreen or when you touch a button.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 That's different. We have to look at what target audience we are aiming for younger people.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they chose below 40. Yeah, that's probably and those young people yeah you saw it in my marketing report. They like the new fancy stuff. Yeah, touch green like Microsoft already developed something like that for multimedia applications. I think we can do that too.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay as you can see the minutes from the second meeting, this one are done.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 I've added this four things from the management board just to keep in mind.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 Each time I had a sort of summary on what you told and what you personal think.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that can be read out. A few things I noticed were...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 The main points in this meeting is I think how it's going to look.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 We must keep it simple but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden or something. So you don't have a big thing full of buttons or the point that you want to use one controller for, hypothetically, each television. So you must the functions like the menus or the parents or control must be all done by the remote control and not by the television. I think that's the point with... We discussed some of them.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 The menus are not identical for all TVs so you have to display in a one-a-tv.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 When you think of the remote and the TV, there's always possibilities to change the color and the brightness and volume. Maybe you can look out if there are options that are remote.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_02
 In this memory you can see what kind of TV it is.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_02
 For us, the feedback is in this and that and then give the options that are capable of.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's an opportunity. You have an international market range.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 So you have big range of personal remotes and they all have functionality for all the TVs.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 So there wouldn't be an extra feature to incorporate the menus.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's not too complex to do it. Well, they all have to be programmed to fit your TV.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 And that is a bit of a tricky job. I actually use one of those.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 They are kind of troublesome. But the thing is, when you start building something like this, you have to build a receiver into the remote. Because in order for the remote to process something from the TV, to synchronize, you have to send and receive.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no. You can just build it.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 It means just one other thing. With the current remote controls, the universal ones, you have to press a code for a TV.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 You look up, I have a Philips H55. It says press code 455 and you press code 455 and the remote and it displays all your menu options. Oh, yeah, sure.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 Now we just connect the TV type to a set of options in just in a memory.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_03
 So if you like profile, if you touch in like 1410, kind of TV, the memory pops up the options.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, that would be possible. I don't think that takes a lot of storage space.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 No, that wouldn't be just for arrival. If you look at the menus from universal remotes, there are maybe three, four hundred TVs at maximum. If you have all of them, all the old and new TVs summed up, so I think it is possible.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 But on the other hand, five minutes to go, on the other hand, if you have a remote, a buy new TV that isn't incorporated in a remote.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then you have to buy new ones, very good from what?

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 New remote, maybe, or an update software update.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 Firmware, I would write. That's firmware. Ah, maybe.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's maybe the cup holder.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can incorporate some kind of USB or a firewire connection so that you can connect it to the PC and download newest firmware from the internet.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, not everybody has a PC at home.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, most people have, but not everybody.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 You can go back to the shop and like a kind of service.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe something like that.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 You can download it for you.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 Or you could actually look at the place, all you talked about earlier.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_00
 And you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or Internet connection.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, all the very digital information is sent to the standard TV connections.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 You can see what's programmed on the new channels.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can send that information along with standard TV.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then you'd be back to the building and receiving.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 If it's actually worth it to build it in, we could actually look into it.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know. It would be bringing more cost for it with it.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service center.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that would be really best.

0:37:08	None
 Yeah.

0:37:08	None
 At the shop.

0:37:08	None
 Yeah.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_00
 Like when you buy a TV, it just, I'll follow.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a lot of work.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_03
 Just one docking station where you put it in, press start, bling, bling, updated.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that would be best.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 You don't buy a TV every week.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't mean a while.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_02
 For which one are we going?

0:37:39	SPEAKER_02
 My mistake.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's about that one or?

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_00
 My vote goes out to the right here.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_00
 Your vote?

0:37:48	SPEAKER_00
 My vote.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_03
 And your vote?

0:37:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I was doubting about which you want to take, but if convinced me that if you display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote or elderly, people will know what to do.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 And also like a clapping, like if I said, almost not open.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 Too difficult or not too difficult.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's easier to break it.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_03
 Break it.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 That is very sensitive.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Like my telephone.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's sensitive.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:33	None
 Yeah.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's almost at the end.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 We have now a lunch break.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_00
 Me?

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 After the lunch break, it's back to individual work.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_01
 Once again, 30 minutes.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 I will put my minutes.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_01
 I have updated them.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_01
 So they're updated in the shared folder too.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_01
 30 minutes.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_01
 30 minutes.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, minutes.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_01
 Fader.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 The specific instructions for the next meeting you will all receive at the email.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think I can say much about it.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 So wait for the email and hopefully you get it done in the 30 minutes.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I will see you after the lunch break in the 30 minutes.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_01
 One question.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_03
 How late do we have to get back?

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 Be back here.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, 30 minutes.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 A quarter to one.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 30 minutes of lunch break.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_01
 30 minutes of lunch break.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_03
 About 45.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_01
 45?

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well done.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 Would it be one o'clock?

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we ask our personal coach.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 It was very good session I think.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_02
 We have possible distorted social documents.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, well.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_03
 Save us.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because all things are stored in Smartboard.xdk and that's in.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 But you can open it from your, from your laptop.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_02
 You can save it as an image.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_03
 Save us.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_00
 I can move.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe an export function.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_00
 Export.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I can.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 HTML.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it usually makes you possible.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_02
 Huh?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 Image?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 Ypeg.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, a tree peg.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_03
 Ypeg.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's better.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_03
 Very precise.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_03
 A4.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 One screen size.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_03
 And this.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_03
 Directory.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's not connected to the...

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 You all have to have the...

0:40:42	SPEAKER_01
 The questionnaire again.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_01
 About the DFT work.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it is connected.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's connected.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 Do you?

0:40:50	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_00
 I'll just save it in my documents.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, am I on messenger?

0:41:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_01
 That's exactly what you're doing.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_02

 Oh, no.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's also filling out.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_01
 I do it after lunch.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm hungry, so I do it after lunch.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_03

0:41:26	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_02
