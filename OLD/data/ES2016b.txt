0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for coming to this meeting.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 How are we doing on our remote?

0:00:55	SPEAKER_04
 We have some ideas and some ideas for what people want.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 I was asked to do it anyway.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_04
 Let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 See if I can't get things moving along here a little bit better.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'll go over what we went over last time, which shouldn't take long.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_04
 And I believe each of you have a presentation.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 I've sent a couple more requirements for our remote, but what they want.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 Then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do and how it's going to do it, hopefully.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll have the closing, which we'll have 40 minutes for.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 The last meeting, we went over who was responsible for what?

0:02:01	SPEAKER_04
 I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes and coming up with the final presentation.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 Corinne is our marketing expert.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_04
 She's going to figure out what the consumer wants.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_04
 Ryan is our user interface designer.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 And Manuel is the industrial designer.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_04
 So you're going to come up with the ideas, Ryan, and you're going to pick them apart.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_04
 We decided our remote.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_04
 We wanted to be a universal remote that everyone would want.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_04
 We want to be modern.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_04
 It's fun, different.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_04
 It needs to be sturdy, easy to find.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to have that locator function.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_04
 And we want to be different.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_04
 And then we went over a couple of different ideas, ball-shaped phone, the keyboard shape.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 We decided that it should probably be one-handed, something we can use with one-hand.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 And that was our last meeting.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 So why don't each of you have a presentation?

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'll hand it off to you.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 Does anyone want to go first so we can maybe see what the people want?

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 What was it?

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 What was it?

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 How do I get it?

0:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 Slice to go to the next one.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 This is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I've sent.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, I actually need to see something else on my screen.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 Hit F8 again.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_04
 Do you want to be on both screens?

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 No, I want something else.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_04
 Is that possible?

0:05:17	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure you can maybe minimize that screen and then have it in both up at the same time.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research on some interviews that were conducted and then some internet research.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 I was sent a report that was, I think, there were 100 remote users that they interviewed.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 I will show you some of the results from that, which I think will be helpful.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 Here are some of the findings.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the users find their remote controls to be ugly, which is a fairly significant number, I would say.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 80% of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think that earlier we were on to something when we were talking about having a modern, cool look.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 They say the current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the users said they zap a lot.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 If anyone could clarify what that means.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Does that just mean like changing the channel?

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 50% of the users say that they're only using 10% of the buttons on the remote control.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_01
 There was something else.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 They kept track of the frequency per hour and using certain buttons.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 Some of them, it looks like, barely needs to be included at all.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, channel selection is used the most frequently.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Then teletext was the next volume and then power.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 The biggest user frustrations, as we said 50% of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 They said 34% said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 26% said that the controls are bad for RSI.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 What is it?

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just a capacitive strain injury.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_01
 So base, as far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they're all for it from the 15-25 age group.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Over 90% said they would pay more.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 It went down incrementally.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 The older they get, it looks like the less willing they are to pay.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could discuss this and think, decide if we think it's worth investing in this, at least if we're targeting the younger groups.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 In conclusion, some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance, since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of the remote control.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 A multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore, so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 We need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons, get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then lastly, I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, very nice. Now we actually have some ideas of what people want, what we should focus on.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Let's make a look at that real quick.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Having just listened, I'll draw on some of the things as well.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to approach the technical functions design.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 The method I used was to explore the technical functions of remote control.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 I had some things sent to me not very much to look at similar devices, defined things from them, and then personal preferences that I would suggest.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 We discussed the universal one.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's just been brought up again then, but I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design and possibly within maybe the budget that we do it because you need to know all the specifications of all the electronic companies.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if you ever come across a universal remote control yourself, but you have to do a nightmare to use, you have to set them, reset them to everything, and that would only add buttons, whereas I think there is to take away buttons.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think it better maybe to concentrate on maybe it's a universal one for TVs, or maybe just one that you could design and then different people manufacturers could use it to set their specifications.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 If the aim is to get something that's unique in design.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, here's just two pictures of remote controls.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 There's just simple TV remote controls, but one is user-centered, that is the one on the left.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 You need to straight away see there's less buttons, and the other one is some engineered centered where that's more specified for the sort of elaborate piece of equipment that's trying to control.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'd ask which appeals more to the product that we want, and on what defines the standard market research and stuff, we're probably looking at something that should be user-centered, fewer buttons, simpler to use, and if 10% is hidden away, if 10% is what's used, maybe the other 50%, the buttons that I use very rarely, like programming, they could be hidden, maybe some remote controls that you might have come across, and maybe a little flip thing where they're hidden away, and the main buttons, the ones you come across.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 And finally, I'm sorry, covered that, our product I think should be user interface orientated.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 Like I said, a concentrate on TV control, universal mode, might be too complex.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 And as what the major finders and market research has said, it's the image and the appearance that people dislike, so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend, and then change the fashion of a remote controls.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 And that's it.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_04
 What was your last conclusion on that one? Focus on the image of it.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 Good, good.

0:14:46	None
 Okay.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'll talk to you about the working design.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 The interior is basically what dictates the design, both the interface and the outer appearance, because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 Unfortunately, the people who are supposed to do this little presentation for me, obviously, were too drunk to actually accomplish it.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to do lots of the stuff on the board.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 This is the basic premise of a remote control. The basic function is to send messages to another system. Okay, so much is clear.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 And energy source feeds an integrated circuit chip that can compose messages.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 Often in the form of infrared bits, this is the most mostly used. There's also some sound systems, but infrared is the better, the more used system parts are cheaper as well.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 A user interface controls the chip, and accordingly, the messages. This is where my people screwed up, basically. So I'm going to explain that on the board, other.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 What we have is different components that obviously need to go in there, we'll start with an energy source.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's usually a battery, right, since it's not feasible to add a cable to that.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 This energy source, of course, is connected to the user interface itself, which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact controls.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Controls a chip.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 This is the user interface, where we have the chip.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 The way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp that sends out the signal.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, the signal differs accordingly, depending on what the chip tells the infrared lamp, and of course that's controlled.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 The chip itself is controlled by the user interface.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 The way you normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well, so that you know that it's working.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, you press something, you get a response, which is also comparatively important on one of those devices.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 Now, what we're talking about here are what I think should be discussed are these two components, mostly the energy source for one thing can be altered.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 What we probably cannot alter is, of course, the infrared, the sending device, basically the infrared lamp.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 We cannot change the chip, which controls the infrared lamp, right, these two are components that we have to use, and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 The lamp can be put on to the device.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't have to be there.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 This can be discussed as well.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface, that's something we can also discuss.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 As we've heard, speech recognition is the hype, obviously, in the moment.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition interface, we don't know that, or if we just do the usual button thing, or we have a touchpad or something like that, that's something we can discuss.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, the energy source, batteries, solar cells, who knows.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it's always a question whether these components are, in fact, available cheap enough, developed enough, but that's, I suppose, rather up to marketing, not to you.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 To the industry of design.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 The more complex we make it, of course, the more expensive it's going to be.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_04
 People have said that they would, well, younger generations of people said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, possibly, it might be worth the investment.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think speech recognition was one of those things where it has to be really good for them to work.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 Sometimes you find yourself saying things over and over and over and do something you phone.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 I agree.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Different dialects, I suppose.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 Myself, I find when you, when there's something that's speech recognition, like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something, sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other hand and you say one for this and you find your, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 I find myself, especially if I'm in a crowd of people, looking really silly.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if, what do you want to keep saying stuff?

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you're watching stuff, if you're watching something, what do you want to do?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 Volume up, volume down, change the channel, you know, channel up, channel down.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 Another thing about these figures is 91% of the youngest age group said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them, that's actually their parents money.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 Like, I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves, a 15 year old, you know.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 As well, it'd be the gimmick factor for the younger people.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's a gimmick factor that they like at first.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 Gets old here.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see here.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I guess so.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 Now, I was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 The remote's only going to be for the television, which is good because we already decided your research showed that not only is the universal remote more complicated, it's more costly, and your research showed that, you know, most of the people don't even use it.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 You said 50% of the people only use 10% of the buttons, so if we remove the universal remote, then that solves that problem.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 No teletext.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 So we don't have to worry about that.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 But we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate color and our slogan, which is we put the fashion in electronics.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 And our corporate colors are gray and yellow.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 We could probably get away with black too.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Those are the three new requirements that I was told we need to use.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 From all three of your presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 We want something that looks good. We want something that's simple. We want something that you can find easily.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the speech recognition, I guess, is kind of give or take. It's going to cost more.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_04
 The younger people say that they like it, but it's probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 And that way we can focus on our form.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 I did have a thought about the tracking thing is that it came with maybe a holder.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 A whole store, if you want to call it, you should put it back in your mode.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't put it back in, you press something like that.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 It just sends out a bit to find where it is.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_04
 That would be good if we were going with our ball.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 Or with any form that would be good. That could be the charger for, you know, we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_04
 And that would be a solar or, you know, however you want to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit with the locator button.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 And if it were the ball, you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 We still have the how to hold on to it.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you put it on the couch table while you're watching.

0:25:30	None
 It's going to roll away.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess after the meeting, we'll have some questionnaires and some summaries for what's going on.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Then we'll take lunch.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 We can come back and work on our individual work.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'll do the minutes.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_04
 What chips we need and what, you know, how to power it and whatnot.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 User interface concept. We want it to be something simple.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_04
 Minimal number of buttons.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 I guess our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_04
 I think we should be able to work on that.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should be able to work on that.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 You have time to work on that.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 You have enough time between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think it still has a bit of variation.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 On a grad time group, but maybe not as silly as a boy.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_04
 Should we maybe shoot for a specific target group?

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 That way, if we were shooting for young guys, then it's a certain look to the remote or girls or older people.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 You think that would help us find a specific form that we would want to pick out?

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if that might come up from the train watching.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Do you find anything for now?

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, not yet, but maybe by the next meeting we'll have something to do on that.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 We know that the remote is going to have to be, we'll just say we've got a color scheme for it.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yellow, it's nice and bright with the buttons being gray or black and are slogan pasted somewhere on it.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 The bottom.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could sketch.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, all of our typical remote are just a rectangular sort.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's more, of course, this will look like a bone.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_04
 Go ahead and erase this.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_04
 I hope everyone memorized that.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, Matt, to look at the shape and trend of things like mobile phones and shapes that they've been going on.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_00
 They've gone from big, big block things, which is what the remote control is.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody's got a mobile phone, except for me now.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 But they are all mobile phones.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_04
 They've taken a turn to where they're really small, which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_04
 But then again, you don't want the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got basically what the remote looks like now is what we're stuck with.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could go with a square or something.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 You know, with minimal number of buttons.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 I guess you've got one through nine typing in your channels.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 We've got volume up and down, channel up and down.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 Power.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 Power.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_04
 Usually at the top.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 A mute.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's pretty much all you need, I think.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_04
 A menu button, maybe.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, if we want the remote to do other things like, I guess, the TV to be able to change the tint and the color and all those kinds of things that are built into TVs, we just have that under one standard menu button where you go and press the menu button, scroll up and down to select it.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 Talking of which, maybe a scrolling function is not too bad.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, talk about maybe look at that from the side there, maybe, which is technically the easiest option would probably be like a scrolling wheel like this.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 Like a wheel on your mouse.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sort of like that.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 You can even, if we're coming from mice, we can add a click function where you, in order to verify the information, you just press it down.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good idea.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 Also, when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing, if you want to make it square for the looks of it, then maybe make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'm going to go bulge down here, which maybe from an engineering point, this could be holding the batteries and so on.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 I know you know what I'm getting at here.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's good.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Look at it from the side.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 You like that.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 Then you hold it in your hand like this and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the, or the more important buttons nearer to the thumb side.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, right.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the buttons could like decrease the bigger ones.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 You know, that is actually bigger in size than the ones that are less important, smaller here.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 You can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again, writing open.

0:34:33	None
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 With the lesser used functions, this part slides into that part.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_00
 Just been sketching something, just like on a sort of side view.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 Something that, you know, sort of fit in the hand better.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 So you know, you just sort of have your hand.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's just thinking this, this of course causes a problem for left or right handed people actually.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's also true.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_00
 That, yeah, instantly, so it's always going through the right hand first.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's the older.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 Is everyone who in here is right handed, left handed?

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 You guys all right handed?

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm left handed, but I, so I can say that most things are designed for right handed people.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_04
 Like the written language.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 Or English.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, special order.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 I would say, I mean, it should be probably designed for a right handed person.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_04
 But that's good.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's, I think we've got kind of a good plan there.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 At least for what buttons we're going to use.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got, I like to scroll, scroll action and the.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I just, just thinking maybe.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 If it was a.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 Circular.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_00
 Um.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 This sort of, that sort of, it's sort of an early idea we had, but the way that was more like that.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas this is just a one handed thing that you sort of almost wrapped around the thumb.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 So you'd have your hand into the thumb there.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 You'd have all the buttons sort of around here.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_00
 And that I think could work.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 On any hand.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_00
 Kind of like holding a, if you just had it like right around there, left, all right.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Minimizes its size wise.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 Minimizes its size.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 You know, really quite small.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 And then there's maybe.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Another point of making it a two and one kind of thing.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 If we have a smaller, a smaller device that actually fits into the big one.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 You have full functions in here and just a couple of functions in there.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Like your zap, zapping device.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's just channels up down volume.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 And on off.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_04
 So two remotes and one.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_04
 But then would be easier to lose one for the other.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 The big one has to be sufficiently big and perhaps heavy so you can't move it around.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_03
 Make it a piece of furniture.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_03
 It actually is your coffee table.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, there you go.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 State you.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we need to finish up here.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_04
 So for the next.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_04
 So for the next before the next meeting.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_04
 Shall we work on your watching trends to see what kind of new information we've got going on.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_04
 Manual, you're going to work on the components for what we're going to use.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_04
 Let's go with our rounded.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of fit in your hand.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_04
 Let's explore the possibility of having the two piece.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 So one for the quick zapping and possibly one with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_04
 And Ryan, you work on how well they'll work with the user.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_04
 So both of those concepts.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I think we made some good progress here.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_04
 We'll see you in, I don't know, I guess we'll take lunch in about half an hour.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:40:06	None
 Okay.
