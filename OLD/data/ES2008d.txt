0:00:30	None
 Okay.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 Welcome to our detailed design meeting.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_04
 I'm pretty excited.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 Let's start.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's approximately 1540 or something like that.

0:00:50	None
 Okay.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 The agenda we're going to do an opening and then I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting, what we discussed.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 Then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_04
 We'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_04
 So starting off with the last one.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have it here.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 But we talked about energy.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to use a kinetic battery.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 We want to use a simple chip because we're not going to need a shuffle.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to need a scroll.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_04
 We're choosing a latex case in fruity colors.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's curved.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_04
 And we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_04
 It sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons, including five preset channels.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_04
 Let's do the look and feel design presentation first.

0:01:52	None
 One.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we made three different prototypes.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 And I guess we'll start with this one.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 We have our colors not fixed, but this is the general shape.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_02
 You hold it sort of either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand or even then there's a whole variety.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 You can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have the on off button at the tip.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 Very visible.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Very big.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 We have our up and down buttons, which are also going to be our channel selectors.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 And we have our little menu button here.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 If you push, if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 If the volume buttons rather, if you press select once, they become channel changing buttons.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 If you press select three times, the menu with the other features and possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 People want to grab a hold of that and see how it feels in your hand.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 That's our number one prototype.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 You want to present the potato or shall I fill with the varsity?

0:03:09	SPEAKER_04
 You're just acting a little lightning bolt in it.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 Very cute.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 I can do about one of the wrong bits.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 This one's known as the potato.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's not presented.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's an ergonomic shape.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 It fits in your hands.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's designed to be used to be the left hand or the right hand.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 I've gone here just before buttons on this one.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 There are two blue buttons here after adjusting the volume.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 This is called volume up and volume down on the other side here.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 The back one is the artboard, and check the channels.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 Channel up and channel down.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 The moves between the bigger channels that you've selected.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 This middle button here is the top-down screen menu.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 When you're working in the on-screen menu, you use the other four buttons to navigate the middle button.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_00
 That's basically it.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 On off?

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 That would be one of your channels.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 Channel zero would be...

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 It turns off.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button?

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's not really...

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really hard to do.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_02
 If you press and held it, maybe.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to call it down.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 That would be on.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 On-off.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 That's the possibility of...

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then finally, we have the Martian or the pair either way.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit different.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little bit more of a creative feel.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 You have the on-off toggle stem on the top.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have the five preset Z.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 And then you have all the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 You have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's for your consideration as well.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 Plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 We figured it could stand up like this on your table if I made the bottom flat.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, what's the other one in the middle?

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 The menu select button.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 Very interesting.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_04
 That was my favorite.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sorry, I'm sorry.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 We were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colors but maybe we're also thinking that you're sort of middle aged man.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 For an example, customer might not want a fruity colored remote.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down, maybe with less contrast on it.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_02
 There's something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but...

0:06:32	SPEAKER_04
 That was one thing that we brought up over email.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if you picked up your email but the feature that we considered for not getting lost.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 We were talking about that a little bit when we got that email.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 And we think that each of these are so distinctive that it's not just like another piece of technology around your house.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be somewhere that it can be seen.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we're not thinking that it's going to be as critical to not cover in a couch.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like, I don't know, you taped to your TV that when you press it, a little like beep goes off?

0:07:12	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think that would be conceptually possible?

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's the most most. It's probably under the city and then not because of the uncertainty that's in the city.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder if it's more just the gimmick than anything else.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how many times the service would be doing that to go with the device like that.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 There might be something that you can do in the shortboard in the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 That's a fair evaluation.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 Getting lost.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 We've decided not to worry about that for now.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the designs are very bright.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 So you're right.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 They're going to stick out.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 So do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality?

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like this is similar to sort of what already exists.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 So we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun, even though this is like what I'm initially drawn to, just because it's like comfortable and like not different.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 I sort of like this one.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_01
 Like I don't know why it just it's like small, but still sort of like cute looking.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 But I also like the side buttons on that one.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_01
 Like I think that's kind of me, but I don't know how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_04
 Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off?

0:08:53	SPEAKER_04
 So then we wouldn't have to do it.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's good.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 Here.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 Stick it on.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 Um, why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria?

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be one, like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 That was, I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, but let me, I have to like write something on the whiteboard.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 So do you need this or just right on the right?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think it would be redundant.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of like a joystick kind of thing.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 Hey.

0:09:36	None
 Okay.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe a little smaller than that.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_04
 No, I kind of like it.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's hard to mess.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it does.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of like.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_04
 There could have a stem like that because I do kind of like the stem.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_04
 It almost helps you keep a grip too.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_04
 Because it goes in between fingers.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 Just think.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 I like this one.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 That would be the most important thing that I'm missing.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea of the, I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 That one.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_04
 I am worried about like using a menu.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 Um, in that, like within menus there are sub menus.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 And so how do you get back to the main menu?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, on the iPad, you just, every time you want to go back you hit the menu button.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 That has a menu button separate from a select button.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 Whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 This is, this is the up and down button.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 So you use the scrolling up and down for the list of choices.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 So you just, you just divide the button.

0:10:55	None
 Okay.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Could these be used for going sub menus or maybe, yeah, maybe it could be one of those if you press down and hold for two seconds.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 Then it brings you back one level or something.

0:11:09	None
 Okay.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 So which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our, um, necessities, but yellowy one is that potato?

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Are we leaning towards the pertaining?

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, okay.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we can obviously change it after we go through these different ones.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 We need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 So what we sort of want to do is we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it doesn't meet that.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all or false if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 So we can do this one first.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 First, we want to know if it meets the fancy looking feel objective.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 So like in my opinion, for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to say it's like a three.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's just my opinion.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 What is each of you?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of think it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or two.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, give it the number.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_04
 I will give it a one.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's creative.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if fancy is the word I would use.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if any of them are fancy.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'd say two because it's unique.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 And two.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 Awesome.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 And same sort of scale for functionality.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 Is it functional?

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's extremely functional.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to give it a one.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's functional.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's also pretty basic.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's under the answer.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_04
 Functional.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 I think it'll get everything done.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think it might be a little confusing at first.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there's some other points I will address that.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 Then I'm going to give it a two.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 Awesome.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 We want to know next if it's technologically innovative.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Did you give a functional?

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 She said this one.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Is it technologically innovative?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Not really.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, not so much because we don't have the LCD screen.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have fancy chip.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Other than what it looks like.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's really a battery.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's a kinetic battery is a big one.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 How many people noticed that though?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 But we know it's there.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 They'll be like, Hey, I have never changed the battery.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 And if it's made of like latex, that whole idea.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty cool.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'll give it a three.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 Because it could have picked a lot of features.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 I would have made it really.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_02
 I would say that it's.

0:14:13	None
 Yeah.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 Like fancy versus creative.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's different.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 It does that.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 You put innovative.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 I'll give it a three.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Why?

0:14:24	None
 I don't know.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's certainly not the case.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's not the main thing.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's just.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's just.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's just.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's just.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think I'm going to go with the four as well.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 Next is it easy to use just so you know, easy to learn will be separate.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 Is it all?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 Overlap them.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really easy to use.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'll give it.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'll give it a one.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 Pretty hard to mess up.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'll let's say two.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 We next want to see if it has a spongy quality.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_01
 And indeed it's made of latex or rubber.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's spongy all the way.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 Give it a one.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 One of the bounces when you drop it.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, then you could.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be harder to break.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_04
 It'd be less impact.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 What do you give it?

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 And the next is does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables?

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, is it going to be yellow?

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 It might be.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's our corporate color, isn't it?

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_04
 Corporate color.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't keep that.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_04
 We want to keep it yellow.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if we.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_04
 I know it would make it a little less a little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black and the design and the outside in yellow.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 That would be our corporate one.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 And then we could also have alternative colors.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_04
 One a more conservative one.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 One is more fruity.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like a silvery kind of white or something.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 Can we have like an R R inscribed on the bottom or something?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:16:07	None
 All right.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it was.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 It was inspired by the potato.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's kind of mango-y too.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it a little one.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 The mango kind of put me over.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 That's a much worse.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 What's everyone's numbers?

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 And does the design match the appropriate behavior?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping in the volume the most.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think we really took that into account a lot.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm an evil one.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 Me too.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 Do you say one?

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Also we talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent any sort of like carpal tunnel-y kind of thing.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'll give it to you because I almost feel like no matter what you do something is going to happen.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 And if it's repetitive movement, it is going to be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 But I'm worth the rest.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_04
 I like how it fits in the hand though.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'd go with it too.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say two as well because older people that aren't used to testing, but if I might bend it a bit.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'll add that first.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 Awesome.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 And the ease of learning it.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 I know you were saying that you were a little bit nervous about that.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_01
 It sort of reminds me of the iPod.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 I just got my excellent read the instruction book and I'm doing okay.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm not good at learning technology.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll give it a two.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 But I think if it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I'd give it a two I guess.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably a little harder than most of the way.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 Because you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what the type of travel is on.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, good point.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Once you've learned how to use it, I think it'll be a four.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think I'd give it a four too.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's a pretty high learning curve.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_04
 It'll be easy once you've done it, but.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 Also earlier, we had something about losing it.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 And so now we're not addressing that at all.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 So we, I think we can kind of say we addressed it with color.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 So in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose?

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to, I'm going to give it a four because I think that you can still, if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it, you're kind of not going to find it, but anywhere else it's going to stand out.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 I said, give it a three.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 It depends how tidy you are normally.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 You give it a four.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Small too.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 We also said simplicity.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 How, how does it address just being simple?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 Simple to use or simple in design.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think overall, because we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 So those are the next two things we're going to look at.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Separate from fancy like that sort of thing.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 Um, it like wants to be simple, but it's not like totally totally simple.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to give it a two.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 I want to give it a three, I guess.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 Three.

0:19:50	None
 All right.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 And fashionable.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 It's totally fashionable.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's hot.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's a mango.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how fashionable can you make a road?

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's bringing technology and fashion together really really well.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot or boat.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 I do like the little more.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the toggle on off switch.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's really appealing.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Number of two.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 That whole thing.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Just that it would serve our audience.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see why not.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different color arrangements.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll give it a two.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 So let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our color concepts is corporate and has an R.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 R on it.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think all of them are.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 And so we're going to do that.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll address it.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Fine.

0:21:14	None
 Okay.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 Now we're going to look at finances.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 I have an Excel sheet that we're actually going to calculate the cost.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 So let me add this first.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 Hand dynamo.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 We're using kinetic matter.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_04
 And we're having one per.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_04
 So we have a little bit of electronics.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
 Single.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 Simple.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 And simple, rather.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 Case.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 Double curved.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's very curvy.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I didn't get a picture of those.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't really know.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 Our case material supplements.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oops.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 We just get one.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 We need plastic and.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 No, we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Assume.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 The wood.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I guess it was rubber rather than rubber.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 It was rubber and special color.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 More than one special color.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we're using.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to need at least two special colors.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what the basic color is.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, but we know that we're having at least three colors.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, are we talking about on each color combination or we know like we'll have yellow and black?

0:22:57	SPEAKER_02
 Is that two special colors?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Or that I think white and black or.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's three.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 Three three three.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the R.R. will be in color as well.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 Interface.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_04
 We're doing push buttons.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_04
 And how many buttons do we have?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Sex.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 With the power.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 Anything else?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, we'll do.

0:23:30	None
 Do we want.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 Are the buttons in special colors?

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't get information.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, wait.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so, so the case material will just have one color, right?

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, does it?

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 We'll be in special colors.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 We're saying per unit.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 So each unit will only have one color.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_04
 And each.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 But the cases could have up to three.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the buttons could be up to three colors.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 That's how it's designed there.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_04
 I like it like that.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 Special form.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 They're all kind of just push button.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think they're fine.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 Special material.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 We want them rubber as well.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Probably.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, do I have to do it per button?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 Do I?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't think so.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think they're all going to be rubbers.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 That's what it matters.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because for the whole case material, it's only one.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's true to make it rubber.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, wait.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 Thirteen point seven.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_04
 Uh oh.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
 What can we reduce?

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's have our buttons all be one color.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 I kind of like the button.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 I would do.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's only going to bring us down to thirteen point three anyway.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_04
 Are we sure this is double curved?

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's single curved.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 We have to know what idea.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 We have no idea.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't get any pictures.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's single curved.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 Why?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's not the.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's a kinetic battery that's kind of expensive, but we have a simple chip.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 Single curve.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 Case material is rubber and it's a special color.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 But that's important.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 That is important.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_04
 It just happened.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 Now it's twelve.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 Twelve.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 Twelve.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 Hey.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 So we're okay.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 We're all set.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_04
 I saved that to our.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_04
 Our.

0:25:41	None
 Our.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_04
 Our.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 Our.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 Big, shared folders.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_04
 So you know.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 Back to agenda.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 Are the costs under twelve fifty euro?

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, they are.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 Let's move on to the project evaluation.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_04
 Project process.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_04
 Satisfaction with, for example, the room for creativity, leadership, team work, the means, and you know, idea is found.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess what we're going to talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got, and used how we used it.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 If we were able to, you know, use our creativity with the information.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 How well I guess I let it.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_04
 How well we worked together as a team.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_04
 The digital pen, the whiteboard.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 I felt very creative.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 I enjoyed making the prototype.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think it was being successful in the two almost only put a gun in the house for the second semester.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 And we'd come up with a thing about the new gifts that are the gifts.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we could have done even better with a little bit more information, like what's a single curve case, how many colors, what do colors count, things.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 But given what we had, I think we did really well.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think we worked together pretty well.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if I had more market research, other than the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could have taken that into account.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 But the fruits and vegetables stipulated by creativity.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 I really did.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 The whole mango idea was great.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the pen was a little distracting for me personally.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 It's heaviness.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 I've just been so conscious of turning the pages.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 That was a bit of a distraction.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 But with the last one, I chose not to do a powerpoint because I didn't think it made sense to.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 So I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think we all made very significant contributions.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_04
 Like each of us was able to, like, if you had your information and I tried to facilitate it without taking over.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 A little finished bodos.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 That's kind of a lot one.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 Can we work at this as the back go remote?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 Should we have that somewhere on the packaging?

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 I have a little more powerpoint.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's like a little jingle.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 I like the R.R. that's going to be etched in.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 Hopefully not with just my thinking out at some point.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 But kind of a useful little gadget.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, thanks to Ian for the design of that one.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_04
 What do we have?

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Our ideas found.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 People should really base their boat's, our troops, our vegetables.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 Or at least be creative enough to think of toggle switches.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 I, et cetera.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 I am really into the idea of comedic batteries now.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'm so excited about them.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 Can I even know they existed?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 I knew you could get watches that had them.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 Like, really quite expensive watches.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 That just would never need a battery because you're always moving your wrist.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 But in other things, I think it would be really good.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 And it, yeah.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, closing at the cost of the budget.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 With the project evaluated.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then just find a questionnaire meeting summary.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 So this is a great product, kids.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've created something really interesting and then we have a market for it.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 Especially if we can produce it at 12.3, which we hope.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the final results.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, really?

0:30:05	SPEAKER_04
 I do like the Martian remote.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that would definitely be my second choice.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_04
 Although the toggle.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 I'm afraid I would break it.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 I would break it.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think I would break it.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 It started because I wanted to have it as a stem.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 It started as a pair, but it started looking weird.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 We're like, what if I could penguin?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 I like that it stands up.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, maybe I should market it to some remote control company.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 So our art.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 A little thing.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 Congratulations.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing will come up until after our meeting.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's supposed to be over at five.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_04
 I got more master classes.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_04
 That's really funny that you got spamming your work.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 Check it out.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_04
 You need to keep in mind your knowledge management.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 I want to make sure you do.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's very work relevant because we did.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 You can see it through the corporate website.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's really deep.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 It takes a little while to get excited to live.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 That thing is pretty cool.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I love Excel.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's one of my favorite programs.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_02
 My inspiration from last time is the interior of remote control being taken apart bit by bit.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 I learned a lot.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 I could probably take a part of remote control now if I needed to.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's a technology out today.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's really interesting.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_04
 I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's really cool.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't see how we could have.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 At least for me.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 If I had pictures of the different parts of the case, I would have probably drawn them up.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 I would have been able to put them up.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_02
 I would have to have a PowerPoint that we can all look at.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 You can do all of those things on the PowerPoint.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 These might have made us more willing to take notes than to write them up here.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 I would have to have them up separately in the whiteboards in this room.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 Because we were all going to be working in different places, if we were all going to stay here all the time, then having the notes up on the whiteboard would have been all right.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 Everyone needs their own specific notes.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 When you were creating your prototypes here, did you work together

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 or do you do separate projects? I would have to have them up and forth.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 It was a bit of both.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 We just started out by each taking a color of clay and just fooling around with it.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 I came out with that rhombus shape and he came out with a potato-y, mango-y shape.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_02
 Then I just went from there.

0:34:48	None
 I felt well-managed.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think we did well in the first festival, keeping our meetings designed.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_00
 We did a good job of making some decisions with men.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 That happened to me all the time though.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_00
 I know what happened sometimes is that men have meetings and people said that the way without anything else would really be decided.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 I think that women have been on the ground and decided to decide someplace now that men are looking to set up the new way to go on.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_02
 I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't really have enough information to make from decisions, but we were able to do it regardless.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to have people say this thing is a little bit different than five minutes.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_04
 I found that we could have used another five or ten minutes.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 Especially last time.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time, not quite enough.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 You know what I mean?

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 We couldn't answer every single question.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 I felt the first two meetings that I was coming in with no information.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_02
 That sort of made me really...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_02
 Throwing together a PowerPoint of no information.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Last time it was the opposite.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 I had so much information and so much to talk about.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_04
 It was interesting what came out later.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_04
 As I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me, that more points came out from your presentation even.

0:36:40	None
 I'm a little...

0:36:45	SPEAKER_04
 I am a little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing the remote because that was kind of a big point.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_02
 That was something like...

0:36:54	SPEAKER_02
 In order to talk about that, we would have had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 Even when we were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't an option to select to somehow have it included.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 There was no way we could be like, yeah, I have them included.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 There's no way for us to have written down that it was really bare.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think we were just getting over enthusiastic with the task.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's interesting really got into it.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I got into it as the day went on.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_02
 I got really like, oh, I'm designing remote control.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if that's just me, but yeah, I suppose.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_04
 It was interesting though that they put that 50% of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information too.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't want to be able to discuss that.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 I know that people have things that can put on their keys, that you press it and it'll be.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think there are some of those infomercial remote that have things so you won't lose them.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we were talking about it.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 In my household, at least there's only about two places that the remote is ever.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_02
 There's only one TB and there's only like two chairs.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's insane. You're never going to lose your keys.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 I always do anyway.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 You'll lose them in your pocket.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like you just won't forget that we're going to put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember there's always ways to lose things.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it depends on how organized you are personally.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or like, I guess what the sense of the house is too.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 But I am notorious for losing my keys.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I've just never lost the remote.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 I put my keys in the refrigerator the other time.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 I find them.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_02
 So I was putting groceries away.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's why.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_02
 You're taking stuff off a bag and putting them in the refrigerator.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_02
 Back to my room.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 Can't get in.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_04
 Look all around the kitchen.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely in the vegetable drawer.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 So I always do the living and my coat and using a different coat.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that's good.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_02
 We don't really carry room out around that much.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_01
 Can't always get into the other room.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it was our little robot when we could have had him have a robot alien pair or whatever he is.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_02
 Have a little voice.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_02
 I am located.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_02
 A GPS.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's an internal GPS.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:39:36	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_02
 Although if it's sitting still for a moment.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_04
 We should make one that walks by itself.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_04
 It really could get up and walk away.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_04
 Or some crazy electromagnet that you push it and it'll zoom to the TV and stick there.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_02
 Or just a wheel.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_02
 Just if you have to ever vote for your robot.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, but if you could attach them to the TV.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_02
 All kinds of possibilities.

0:40:15	None
 Okay.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, I'm just trying to update my minutes.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_04
 I decided to, you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_04
 Rather than like repeating.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just going to make them full minutes so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, because it seems a little more useful.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_02
 So you had the most typing and organizing to do.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_04
 But I didn't have like information to swap.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_02
 How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you?

0:40:49	SPEAKER_02
 Every meeting.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_04
 Most of it.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_04
 I added slides.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_04
 I added a couple slides each time.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_04
 But that's better.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't even think about adding slides because I would just get slides with titles on them and build them all in.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_02
 Didn't even think about adding more.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the thing was it would provide you an agenda with like several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_04
 And that's the only way I remember that I need to go over that point.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_04
 I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_04
 So I added ones, even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:41:36	SPEAKER_01
 You have to have a slogan on it or can it just be like the slogan on it?

0:41:43	SPEAKER_01
 No, different.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_01
 We could go around the other side.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't think we need to.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow and black one.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow and blue.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_02
 Let me go to the web page.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_04
 I was just kind of going by the web page because they didn't give me any clear yellow gray.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_01
 Gray.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_01
 Gray.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's better than black.

0:42:09	None
 Doesn't look so bumble lady.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_02
 I really understand the reading.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_02
 Finish meeting now.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_04
 Wasn't it interesting that I thought it was interesting that our marketing expert did not agree with the marketing choices.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, because I just think you're really doing like a really big market evaluation.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_01
 You wouldn't just have like one set of sources kind of and they weren't so not backed up.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_01
 It would just be a sentence being like we did a survey.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_02
 People are stupid.

0:42:53	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's sort of like gray, isn't it?

0:42:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow and gray, but then the slogan is in blue.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we got some gray and we got some blue buttons.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_01
 We're good.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 Well, they don't have the right color clay anyway.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe like, I don't know.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think I always be something.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're not sadly meant to actually be producing this.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, if they ever come out with potato potato bag.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to clean the intellectual property.

0:43:30	None
 Yeah.

0:43:31	SPEAKER_02
 I can't believe the whole day.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_02
 I feel like it's been that long.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's like a...

0:43:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:43:43	None
 I'm actually there.

0:43:44	None
 Yeah.

0:43:45	None
 Yeah.
