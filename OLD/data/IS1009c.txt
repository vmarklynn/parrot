0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Any good here?

0:00:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Hello everyone.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 Hi.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_04
 How are we doing?

0:00:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, good.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 First, we're going over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 In the last meeting, the marketing manager had presented her method of working, meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product within the budget that was given.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 In general, the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's also an item that people lose a lot, so we should address that.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_04
 And of course it should be something that is very simple to use.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 In addition to that, to make it sell, of course, the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive, or like she says, put some sizzle into it in one way or another, so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items, that's a very important fact, because if they say, well, I go home and think about it, that won't work.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_04
 Also mentioned was it should have a very short learning curve, and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 Our technical manager has then said that he feels it should have a chip that has infrared bits, and it has an interface that controls the chip. Therefore messages will be controlled in the same manner.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_04
 There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_04
 If too many buttons are pressed, a child lock, and maybe a display clock, so that people could see the time, you know, what show they want to watch.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 Also mentioned was maybe different shapes.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_04
 So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infrared bulbs, battery chips, wires, and maybe some kind of a holder for the item.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_04
 Pranchina, who is our interface designer, has mentioned that the, of course, should have an on-off button, and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock, particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 It should be compact, her personal favorite was it should be T-shaped, and maybe having an alarm clock and the material should possibly be of non-allergic nature.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 The different systems that exist are infrared or radio waves, maybe it should have electricity saving feature, and even possibly a timer so that people can program their favorite program on right from the remote.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 Are we all in agreement that that's bad?

0:04:42	SPEAKER_04
 What we discussed last time?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I got pretty much the same.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, then we are looking for three presentations, and I don't know whether the order matters much.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 So whoever wants to...

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 I can stop.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 Am I asleep, please?

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_04
 Come on, close already.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_04
 And that's number two, right?

0:05:24	SPEAKER_04
 Three.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 But it's been three.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like, so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 Next, please.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 This messages could be a switch on-off message, or switch to next channel message, or swapping the channels, or switching on to a particular channel.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 Like you can have the numbers one, two, three, four, up to nine.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 Nine, what, nine channel switches?

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 Pardon me?

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Nine channel switches?

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 Nine numbers.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have swapping button, by which using which you can swap the channels.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 If you don't want to see the third channel, you can swap it to the fourth channel, or vice versa.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 Then it should have a next button, a next button channel, by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide, please.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then you should have a button which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 Then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program, which is going on a television.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television, so that the subtitles on the screen.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Then there should be some buttons which can control features like the color of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 Now there should be a memory switch.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 There should be a mute button.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 Suddenly if a viewer gets a telephone call, and if he doesn't want to switch off the TV, but he can reduce the sound.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 He can bring the volume down and he can watch, while talking he can watch the TV.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 So remote can be designed which can have the voice recognises.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 You can record your own voice, which can be recognised by a voice recogniser in the television.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you want to see the ninth channel, if you say just say ninth channel, the remote will automatically switch to the ninth channel.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 So the TV will have some recognises which will recognise the user's voice, and accordingly it will change its functionality.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 So this is one of the very important features a remote control can have.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 So this is one of the interface which can be created.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 A very simple interface which has all the important features.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour, but they have many buttons.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 So sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 So you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 Even a kid can use that.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 So can you go on to the next slide?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 So this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this voice recogniser.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 And this has multi-purpose use.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 It can be used for TV, it can be used for cable satellites, it can be used for VCR DVDs and audio.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 And this has inbuilt voice recogniser.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Can you go on to the next slide?

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 Now this is an interface for a remote which a child can use.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 This is user friendly, it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 And this comes with different colours, different shapes.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 And this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small compact attractive child interface.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide please.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Now this is a big oversized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to display.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 You don't know me.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 I can lose that in a minute.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is a very big container.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 Let's play with it anyway.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 So this is a Jambu universal remote control and it's impossible to misplace or lose.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 This is one such interface which can be created.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 And the personal preference would be to incorporate speech recognises which will respond to users voice for a particular function.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Thank you very much.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_04
 Any comments on her presentation?

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 Well, looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'm no suggestion is bad but we're going to have to narrow it down a little more.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think that we can get the T-shape is good, the child one is good.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's a too big to misplace, I think it's just funny.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think that's going to be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think these are her presentations but as far as the decision making we get to that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'll come back to that later.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 But if I just wanted to know whether anybody had anything to add to her presentation.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Who wants to go next?

0:12:54	None
 Okay.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 The next one.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Oops.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 The components design.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 This time I'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 Can we go on to the next slide please.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 I have just brief down a few components which we require for the remote control construction.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 The first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit, battery etc.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 It can be a plastic one, hard plastic so that it can be strong even if it falls down then it doesn't break.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 So it should be strong and there are no harmful materials used in that and it should be recyclable.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 And also using of coloring compounds like if we want to have different colors blue, red, green.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to use some coloring component components.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 And the second important thing is integrated circuit.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 We can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the heart of the remote controller.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 If it is not efficient then everything is going to be less efficient.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 So we should have a highly sophisticated one and it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 Suppose if it is 38 degrees outside, 40 degrees outside it should be able to resist the temperature high temperature and low temperatures.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 And it should be equipped with timer and alarm facility.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 And the other component we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_00
 And also a capacitor which is a battery capacitor. Can you go to the next slide please?

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 A diode, a transistor, a resonator. These are all the technical electronic components which we have to use in a remote controller.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 If we need to make a rechargeable battery then we need not go for a high performance battery.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 Even if it is a low performance battery it can't charge much. It's not a high voltage battery.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 If it is a rechargeable one then people can use it for a long time.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_00
 So in that way we can cut the cost but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 And we have a circuit board in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide please?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 And how it works, how the remote controller works.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 When you press a button...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 Go away.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 When you press a button, when you do that you complete a specific connection.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 That means when you press a button there will be a small circuit underneath the button and it will send some signals through the wires.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 And then the chip will send that connection and knows that which button is pressed.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 Suppose you have pressed channel 1 button, number 1 you have pressed.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 Then the chip will know that the number 1 button was pressed. It produces a more score line signal specific to that button.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 Every button, every individual button has its own more score.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 Suppose the user has pressed button 1 then it will have a circuit will generate a specific more score to that button.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 And the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the LED which translates the signal into infrared light.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_00
 Like you have got a signal by pressing a button that more score has been generated by the integrated circuit.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Now that signal that more score has to be amplified by the transistor.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 That is the use of transistor which we use in the remote controller.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_00
 It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the LED and which translates the signal into an infrared bits.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_00
 The sensor in the TV can see the infrared light and seeing the signal, it reacts appropriately.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 That when it sees the amplified more score signal then it will know which action it has to do.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 Then it will do the appropriate action.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 So this is how the remote controller works.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 Can I go to the next slide please?

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 I have few pictures when you look at the remote controller.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 This is a normal remote controller.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 And to the next slide please.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 And we had a few buttons and all.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 And if you open the remote controller you have this circuit board and few electronic components.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can see a chip there which is having 18 pins and also a capacitor, 3 resistors and also resonator.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 And the diode transistor.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 All of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can see the TA, double 1, 8, 3, 5 labeled as chip.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 You can also see the green things are resistors and just beside that you can see a transistor.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 And the cylinder shape that one is a capacitor and also there are resistors.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, there is a diode.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_00
 Can you go on to the next slide?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 So this is the circuit board.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_00
 In one is a circuit board.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 A building a circuit board is pretty easy and also inexpensive.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 It costs less than what you print on a paper.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because when you are building some circuits and also wires it is better to go for printing.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can build these kind of circuit boards on a bulk and it is just printing.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_00
 Nothing like you know you do not need to use wires and all.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 It is not exactly wires we are using.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
 It is just printing something on a board.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 Those prints will act as wires and circuits.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 So that green thing is a circuit board.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 And also you can see there are like access for buttons.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 Like when you press a button the circuit under the button will be activated.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 It will get some signals from it and it will send the signals to the integrated circuit.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Can you go to the next slide please?

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the circuits underneath the buttons.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 Can you see the black round marks?

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 They are the circuits.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_00
 Next please.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 And like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead of buttons we have some scrolls.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 But a push button requires a simple chip underneath it.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 But whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 Like for scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and full complete chip.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 And as energy source we offer a basic battery.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 More engineers are hard dynamo.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 A kinetic provision of energy.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 Modern watches that you shake casually to provide energy.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_00
 So with that also we can have in a battery or we can use solar cells.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's interesting.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 The product can be delivered into different cases.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 Usually the cases uncarved flat that we see usually normal remote controller.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 You have more pictures.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 We have five minutes to the end of the meeting.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I have just one more slide I think.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 Like we can have materials such as plastic, rubber wood, titanium but titanium we can't use.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 And also for electronics we can use a simple and regular or an advanced chip on the print.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_00
 Also it includes infrared sander.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 And for the movie just to develop samples and so to speak sample speaker.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's all for me now.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 Any particular comments by anybody?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 On the scroll on the push button.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_03
 Can you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button?

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 The scrolling was different.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can go for switches like buttons or scrolls which we used to do before 10 years before I think now nobody uses it because you need a sophisticated chip and all.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just go for push buttons for interest of cost.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision at the marketing.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 Expert has to present her.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_05
 You're right in my next slide.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 My method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing and want to see how we can make ourselves different from the competition.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_03
 So I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_03
 And then when I'm out in people's houses or meetings or anything like that.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 And if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_03
 And I would encourage you all to do the same.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 And my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 People like something that really fits in their hand.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Simple is beautiful.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 They don't want to have to squint at small print.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 They want buttons whose functions are obvious and they want as few buttons as possible.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 And they don't care for the mode thing.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 They want each button to do something.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 And eye catching is important.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's got to look cute.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's got to look appealing.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Go ahead.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm trying to finish fast for you.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 And our preference is as far as I'm concerned, we've got to get to the market before the competition.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out there Christmas item.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_03
 And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_03
 If we try to tell people it has too many great features, the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got to narrow our selection down to two things I think that we're going to say are really great about our new product.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 They're more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_03
 So those are things we want to look at as far as saleability of the item.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, that concludes the presentation of everyone.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_04
 And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 And so what do we think on the concept of the remote?

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 You want to try to come back to yours?

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recognizer.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 So speed tracking is most important as far as you're concerned?

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 This could be one feature which could be sellable.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that could be our star feature. That might be really good.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 I agree with that.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm very much doubtful how far it will work because speech recognizer has its own...

0:26:17	SPEAKER_00
 Distance problem?

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's not distance problem.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's recognizing a person's voice.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_00
 Like maybe different people will be having different voices.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, like every time you say something.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 You have to teach.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 I get a good recognizing system.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's like you're recording a question already.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 And then you're expecting an answer from...

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 For example, you have a TV system. I'm the user.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 And my family members are the user.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 I've already recorded a question like good morning, like around 8 o'clock.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 I want to see the news in the television.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll say this good morning and the TV will switch on.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 It will recognize my voice.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, before we get too far off here, the components of the concept is the energy.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of energy do we foresee?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think we all agreed on that.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's going to be most cost effective and the best thing.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, then chip on print.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_04
 And the case. And I think we all agree on the case.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_04
 We want to have something maybe bright, colorful.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Bright, colorful, trendy design and compact.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_04
 Do you need design, compact and strong?

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 User interface concept, interface type supplements.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 I will be your area.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_00
 Like the switches, like we use buttons for user interface.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 Push buttons.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_04
 Push buttons.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_04
 I guess for, yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure what they mean by supplements.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 There's like different types of features buttons.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or like, or like her speech recognition, it would also be a supplement.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 Her speech recognition.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_03
 So why don't we put down speech recognition, if possible, pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 Our next meeting will be in 30 minutes.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 And the ID is to, this is the individual actions to be taken until then.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_04
 To have the look and feel design.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the UID is supposed to come up with the user interface design.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 And the marketing expert with the product evaluation.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_04
 In this phase, the two of you, Yana and Francine, have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 It says here.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 If you have any questions, you know, you can always contact me or your coach, I suppose.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 We're, they're hiding.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in 30 minutes.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 According to our timetable here.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you very much.

0:29:49	None
 Thank you.

0:29:56	None
 Thank you.

0:30:03	None
 Thanks.
