0:00:00	None
 You see that? You can see that.

0:00:02	None
 Okay, I'll Berry do just pick on you for a little while guess what be tat scrwhat?

0:00:20	SPEAKER_04
 So let's start our second meeting on conceptual design.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 So as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we will have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we will close the session.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 So I will first...

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 You do the minutes first or?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think I will let our user interface on designers speak first.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_04
 Mr. David Jordan.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 So I will...

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 Technical... that's this one?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_04
 Interface.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_04
 This one?

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 So first I will present the concept of user interface.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 There are three concepts in the user interface.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 The first one is the Google controller.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 The second is the fancy controller.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 The last one is the intelligent controller.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 So there are three concepts in our controller.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 Next I will explain my outline.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 The first is the Google controller.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 So I want the controller to be easy to use but with sophisticated functions.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 This is the first concept of our controller.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_01
 The second concept is the fancy controller.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 So without giving the customer the impression that our controller is very attractive.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 We can easily recognize our controller among a lot of products.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 So the user interface would be very cute.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Very attractive.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 Such as these are several examples in these slides.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 They want it to be so extremely cute.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's very big.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy for me to remember it.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_01
 I need to recognize it.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 Why not?

0:03:19	SPEAKER_04
 We'll have big discussions with our experts after that.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_01
 So the last concept is the intelligent.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 We want our controller to be smart.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we should use some technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to have some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and on gesture recognition.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 With these advanced features, I think we can attract a lot of users.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Something else?

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 This is the three concepts of our...

0:04:05	SPEAKER_04
 I just have one question because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 But as the expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think they will be able to use gestures because if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that?

0:04:35	SPEAKER_04
 Or if you say channel 3, channel 3, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, I think they will be born after a while.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 You don't think so?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think sometimes it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you cannot find your controller, you can't use it.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 Just speak something such as one.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 So you can use the gesture. That's a good problem.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 How is it very easy to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition?

0:05:15	SPEAKER_01
 For limited vocabulary speech recognition, it's very reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition, it's also very easy.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching TV and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work?

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody wants to change channels at the same time?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 But this would never happen anyway.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 If you have one brother and one sister, they want to watch their favorite TV program, so they say, oh, channel 4, channel 3, channel 4.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so all the time.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 The same can happen even if you use it. It's kind of remote control.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you have the remote control. So maybe you can keep it with you.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 You're not a blind gesture.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you mean it could be a problem for this guy.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you have the controller. I can say channel 3.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_01
 So this is a disadvantage.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a disadvantage.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_04
 This is a advantage.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can have a switching mode to pass from voice controller to...

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 But one other question, how much will it cost?

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 How much?

0:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I suppose we need to do research. Do you have something working?

0:06:24	SPEAKER_01
 No, we just...

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'll use some efficient.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 We just have some cooperation with some research institute. We don't have to do some basic research on this.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you think it won't cost in... not a lot for us?

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's because this technology is limited or lack-seeking recognition.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's very...

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's changing how the remote control is going to be built.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 Because then you need...

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this doesn't have the power to do recognition, for example.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 You have also the language protocol.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because it has to be universal.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I agree with some.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 But there's not a problem.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there's one problem that Baba talked about.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's the international remote control.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 We need something that is international.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_04
 Suppose we want to set it in France.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 The recognition system will be able to understand French.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the key...

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 This could be downloaded by the webinar.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 The key feature of our control is that it has some adaptation.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 It means when you sell this controller in China, it can...

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 If you sell this controller, you can't use it.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very smart...

0:07:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a smart control device.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and with no increase in the production price of the remote control?

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Because of this product, this technology has already been developed.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but the problem is how to...

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 If this is a push button controller, you can send this remote control everywhere in the world.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 The same one.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the language, you have to develop for each count.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's why we have to do language adaptation.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 In the French country, you have to do one.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because for example, for even for different family, we have to do...

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to do adaptation tools.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it seems to be quite complex.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to take care of the 12 euros...

0:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 And what about voice recognition?

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have microphones and where we'll be there?

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think if we are far from television, it will work?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's not a problem, because you don't have to wear a microphone.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 The microphone is embedded in the controller.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but where is the controller?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 There is a controller.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it your family?

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Your home?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but here it's an object.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_04
 But here you say you want to use a technology...

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can embed it in a microphone here.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but what is the use of voice or just recognition if you have remote control like this, if you have an object?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to use voice or gesture, you need to be free without any objects.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 You just want to interact with the device.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just put the controller here.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 If you say one, you see your command and you do your gesture.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you can lose it.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's...

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 If you lose it.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, but for example, if it is somewhere in the room, if it is in the table there, you can always say it's channel one and the remote control gives the audio to the TV.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so you can build to kind of like box and put it on TV just to recognize gestures and voice.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but so you need a camera and a microphone.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 So you would still have the buttons or do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 Or you still have the possibility to use buttons?

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should give the flexibility to the user.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you can see the gas switch from bi-modality to another.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know. It's a bit risky.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 I think so. Maybe it will be quite...

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 Quite attractive.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think that switching from one counter to another will be a problem.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 We should have confidence in technology.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we should.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 So, what do you think? Which are the controllers you'd prefer?

0:10:57	SPEAKER_05
 What?

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 Which kind of controller would you prefer to use?

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 You as a remote control user?

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm sure if the user pays the same price, he's happy to have recognition.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 But if it like doubles, no one will...

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think he would prefer that he's very reliable.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it would be better not to do near-the-lute-gen controller and to stay with the Google controller or fancy controller.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 So, if you stick to the first two parts, so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market?

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 There's no features of our controller.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, is there any necessary to design new controller without...

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think it works through features.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, I mean, do you replace your controller?

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think it works through the other two parts.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market?

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 No, I mean... do you replace your controller with a controller with similar function?

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 If you do not have some function...

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 I had for example some function like for browsing in the internet or something like that.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 But I think a user needs...

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 That's not the function of the controller.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 That's the function of TV.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can replace your TV with a new TV with internet browser function.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 No, but you need a new remote controller then.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because if you want to browse internet...

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have any...

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to type something...

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, if you want to send a mail from...

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's not only the problem.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's also the issue of the TV.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 The problem I can see is the voice or gesture.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 Because we can't have it in a family.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 We cannot rely 100% on these features to use the controller.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 But the features of our controller, such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 But you seldom use it in your mobile.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 But you choose a new mobile.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 You choose a VAMB voice recognition.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 The feature is not 100% reliable.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 But it's a feature to distinguish our product from our products.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_04
 We want something that works all the time.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 Every day, every hour.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 For everyone.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 The person of the family.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 If you don't need to do this...

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 If you already have a product, it works 100% reliable.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Would you replace it with another one?

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, why not?

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 For example, we would like to have a Google-like controller.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 Google is simple, works fine.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 I guess if we can have a remote control that is really basic, simple and works fine, it's already in a lot.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 There's no big difference between the traditional controller.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 If he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 Not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 It does no key feature in the new controller.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's the problem.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 But you have to think the user is the one who is going to buy the product then.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so let's go to the industry old designer.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, do you want to?

0:14:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, pass it on to working.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 So, I can...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 Can you go to the next one?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's not this one.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's not working this way.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 Come on, honey.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, this is what describes using.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think there's something wrong with the user.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Did you receive it?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you record it somewhere else.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 Pass it on to one.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 Pass it on to one.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 To face concept.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I record it directly on the computer.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 It seems that we have a problem with the...

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you remember what you had to say or...

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 I can say it without...

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so...

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can first come to...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think it would be more interesting to start with...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's more interesting.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 We will have some more information.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would be interesting after your presentation to have...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_04
 Baba's presentation.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, I don't know.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 It was in fact to design use to show you the design of what is inside and what are the different components of the...

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 of the remote control.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, it would be interesting so I could show you some picture of what is inside.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, in fact, something I want to discuss is which kind of material are you going to use?

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, it would be a wooden remote control or plastic remote control like this one.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, in which...

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 which kind will be the different button?

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, it can be some classic push button like this one or you have also some button like LCD where, you know, the buttons are unlighted during the night or you can see them in the darkness.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of electric elementation we want to have.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, will it be, for example, solar energy elementation or will it be a battery like the classical battery?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 So, and I think that for example for the elementation it would be good to have both of them.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, for example, in some country where you are in the countryside and you are far from the cities.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 For example, in some place in Senegal. So, if you have solar elementation, you just, when you want to have recharge your remote control power, you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can comment.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, it can be interesting for people to have this kind of...

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 It can be something interesting to make people buy.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the electrical consumers.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 And, but apparently the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of prediction or no?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, having them both will, if you want to have battery, regular battery and the solar energy battery, it could be, it will add a little bit of the price.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 But it will be an added value also that will be compensated.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the materials?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 And the materials, it depends. For example, if you have a wooden material, it can be more...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 The plastic material is more common. It's very resistant.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, something wooden will be like, I don't know, special high, special high class.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and if you, we want to put fashion and electronics, maybe we can try to do something we would.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, even if it is not completely wood, but just a part of the wood, it will be wooden, in wood and it can be interesting.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's interesting.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 So the last point is, also, we do want to have some very cheap integrated circuit chips, or we have low level or very expensive.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 It depends.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that low level will be, you know, it is an entry material.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I want something easy to use, and so I think maybe something very low level would be enough.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 And you think that we will be...

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it will fit on the price you want, 12 year or so.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_04
 So wood and what about the buttons?

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think the buttons, I prefer, you know, the LCD, you know, lighted buttons, because, you know, it's...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's a special, yeah.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to watch TV in the darkness, or if you want to find your remote control that is lost in the darkness, it's very easy.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_00
 What about the touch screen, for example?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's expensive, I guess.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think the touch screen will be as expensive as the LCD button, so...

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 And it is a kind of design.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 It can be also interesting to have this kind of...

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 So you got the email?

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think we have only five minutes left.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 What have you been there for?

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 Functional requirements?

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 No train watching.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 The other one.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 This one?

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 Just...

0:21:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_00
 So just to meet the user requirements, I would just do a short analysis of the remote control market.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 And to kind of have a better overview of what the fashion in general have checked more than only the remote control market.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_00
 So next.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 So again, it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 You really want a fancy look and feel. They are not so interested in a functional look and feel like the one you've shown David with all the buttons.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it sounds good technically, but it's not what they want.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 So second point, they still want it to be technologically innovative.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 So that were the three first points from the remote control analysis.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Now, if we look at fashion in general...

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 What we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is inspired by fruits and vegetables.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the thing.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's really what people want, even if it's in general fashion, we want it to be in the remote control.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 And then if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look and feel on the score of seven would have six as important.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control has to be technologically innovative.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's three, then easy to use.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's not so important, actually, with respect to other ones.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 So we see fancy looking feel is the most important one.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 And then if we combine this with the fashion from Milan and Paris...

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's fruits and vegetables.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 We go to the fruits and vegetables.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 And the other point I haven't mentioned is people want to have a spongy touch.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 So this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 But the point is which kind of material do you need to be spongy with?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this would be like plastic-like, but rubber.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Very smart.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not rubber-like device.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, that was the main point, I think, from the train in fashion.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to take decisions about the confidence concept about the energy.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 So as you say, you want something technologically innovative.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe using solar energy.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, solar, I think.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 With battery would be something interesting.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we'll attract...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 Pro-ecology consumers.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 Chip and Prince, so you propose low-level chips would be enough to have something working well.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_04
 Case.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Leave it.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 So you think...

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 Something is spongy?

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 No wood.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not wood, but I mean wood.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe not the part you're touching.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can have wood, for example, in the bottom.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe the device.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 The design you want.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's natural.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's natural.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's natural.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can stay with wood.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 And it can be correlated to energy, solar energy.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 So for the marketing aspect, you know, saying...

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's not exactly right for the spongy.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's not right.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_04
 But it's still fashion.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 We could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons or...

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, something that you can enter.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the user interface concept?

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Google and...

0:26:12	SPEAKER_04
 Google and fancy?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 And fancy.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 How about the voice?

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition, there are still some disadvantages with this.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 It is an interesting concept to see to have voice control.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Smart control.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 And the point is we can enter the...

0:26:42	SPEAKER_02
 If you have voice control, why not to put it directly on the TV?

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 You speak directly to the TV.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 And you don't need a remote control actually.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 It will be embedded on the TV and not on a remote control.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe try to mix these two concepts together just in one and...

0:27:11	SPEAKER_04
 Do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with low-level chips and wood.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_04
 Good.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 And LCD buttons.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think for these supplements, the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 And what can we think as a supplement to what interface?

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, for the interface something added value.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think the supplement can be the voice.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 It is not the most important way.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 It can be a part of...

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 With a module, you're in a remote control with a module if you want.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_04
 You can just use commands, words and use them when you don't want to use their fingers.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 Even if it is for just some keys like switching channels, one, two, three, four...

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 Turning the TV on or off.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_02
 Not very complex commands but easy commands.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 So adding some vocal commands.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:38	None
 Simple ones.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, simple ones.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 So next meeting will start in 30 minutes.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 So you will all have to work in your direction.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have to work on the look and feel design to add the easy to use, powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 You will have to work more on the spongy way to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 And I think we will have to evaluate the product.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 Not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables, trends.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 And remember as I said last meeting, we really have to build to fashion remote control and the color of the society will be really...

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 It will be seen in the remote control.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have Baba and David Jordan.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 You will have to work together on the prototype.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 And you will have next time to show us modeling a clay remote control.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have to model something.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 So no more questions.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 We can close the session.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 Sounds good.

0:30:37	None
 Okay.

0:30:38	None
 Okay.

0:30:39	None
 Cool.

0:30:40	None
 So.

0:30:41	None
 Okay.

0:31:06	None
 Okay.
