0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Good to see you all again.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 This is our functional design meeting.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we put the fashion in electronics.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, our agenda today, just took time.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to do an opening, talk about, did you all get the minutes?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 I emailed them to you.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_04
 I'm also putting them in the shared folder.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 We'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_04
 And then we have to make a decision on remote control functions.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_04
 Finally, we'll just close.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_04
 Starting this meeting at approximately 12, 13, we have 40 minutes.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_04
 First of all, the functional design objectives.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 We need to keep in mind the user requirements specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled, the textual functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, and the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 We have three presentations.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 Go in any order you choose.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, please do.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Rest.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 Put the spoolock in.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 rise down again...

0:03:16	None
 touch the blue moon, open?

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it's like... is it plugged in all the way and you'd screwed it in and...

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, wait, it's screwed.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think you just have to push it in really hard.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, got it.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 Let's tighten it a little bit.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not attached to anything.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is, but I don't even know how to play this.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 Press the little presentation.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's the... it looks like a Y kind of over there above draw.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 There.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 That one.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're just going to talk a little bit about functional requirements that people specified when they were asked.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 I guess real reaction did some market research.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 They had 100 subjects in their usability lab and they watched them, watched TV and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 What they found was they analyzed people's desires and needs.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Focusing on their desires, people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the 100 subjects noted that and that they, more importantly though, 80% said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know anything beyond what fancy means, but that's particularly of use to us, I think.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 Also, they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, whereas the older people in the 60 and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 People also had certain frustrations that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design, that being people frustrated with losing their remotes.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think over 50% of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 People were also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before, just that there's too many buttons, it just needs to be easy to use.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 It also mentioned something called RSI and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is, because I don't know.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, people did not like that, so I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_01
 People did not like that repetitive use, I guess, caused a strain.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Looking at the needs people specified, the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behavioral.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 People are only using 10% of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 What people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 People also zap to change the channel, about 65% during an hour of use.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 We really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers, rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings, and the channel settings, because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that some things that we might want to think about, the idea of an LCD screen was brought up, although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were, so I don't know if that's coming to me later, something like that, but something for us to consider.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on their remote or what we want to make, easiest to use, make sure that something like an audio setting is given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer, we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly, and that it feels like the way they're going to use it so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you very much, that was great.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_04
 Let's move on to the next presentation on effects.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 Is that you?

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's in shared if I did it right if anyone wants to look at it.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, thank you.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to talk about the technical functions of the line of the remote control.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 You need to start by considering what the remote control actually is.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 So it's basically a communication device.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 We tell the remote control what we want to be.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 It sounds a message to the television saying change your channel or change your volume.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 Adjusting the settings, adjust the brightness.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 How do we actually go about designing any television remote control?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 We need to know what our final product is going to be like.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 So we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does, how it works, and what the end user is going to want from this product.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 A way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 And then trying to get some feedback about how well these particular prototypes work.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 So to find out what people think of them.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 Using a remote control is quite a subjective experience.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 And different people just refer different things.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 We should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment when the user is using a remote control.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 He or she expects the buttons to be in certain places.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 So in some sense we're going to have to aim for the device which is fairly conventional in design so that we're not completely shocking people.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 But I think within that there is also a room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps a little bit different, something that stands out.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 Also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 The first of these is technological.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 What can we do with the current state of technology as it is?

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 The second is economic.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 We need to find the balance between features and vice.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would add to the vice.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 But it would also improve the design of the product.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 So I had a look on the web to see if I could find a few examples of existing television in the remote controls.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 In analyzing these we can consider what things go about them, what things do they get right, what's bad about them, what's wrong with them, how we can improve the designs that are found and what can we do to make our product stand out from the large majority of the remote controls.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 Here's two examples, probably of the extreme ends of the spectrum.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 On the left here we've got an engineering based design for the remote controls.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 So it's one that's got lots of buttons, it's fully featured.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Everything you might possibly want to do is just go forward backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, these things.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it, but once you've learned it, you can do whatever you want with your TV.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 One on the right is a lot more basic.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's just got the essential functions of the TV, changing the channel place, not volume.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, but again it swings a lot about the design.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's about the disadvantages you can't use it, so to please the television picture.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 There's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got to find a way of striking a balance between the two.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 As I said before, the very controls are subjective.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Different people want different things.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 Personally, what I want remote control is a device that's simple. It's easy to use.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 It does everything that I need it to.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_00
 As I said before, I'm quite lazy. I don't want to walk across the view just to adjust my television.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 I also want something that looks cool and that feels economically designed.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you very much. That was very useful.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 Neither of them were very pretty.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that could be our selling point.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 Fashion, fashion, the mode, right?

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 There's certainly a market technology that looks cool.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's my company like Apple.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 I really can't see what I'm doing, so does anyone have a...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 There it is.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, look at that.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 I've been up already.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 So, wait, did it let you go on the internet or was that just what you've seen?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 That was just on the internet.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Because I was like, yeah.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 You're willing to go to my quiz.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 Let me go.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 No? How do I play again?

0:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's right above draw.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's with bottom.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_04
 There are three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, this is our working design presentation.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 I had a bit of some issues with this because I wasn't able to find everything I needed, but I guess that's...we're still in early stages.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, this is this.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 The thing about working design is what we're trying to do as a working designer is figure out how the apparatus can fulfill its function.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 One of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then put the beans through a filter and that filters out.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 And then you get coffee at the end.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but how do I get to the next...

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, the method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 What needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done?

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 So, the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, you make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted towards this practical function.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 And then I think the easiest thing to do is going to be work on each task separately.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 You just press the edge of the back.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, the findings that I got very...just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 And in my opinion, infrared is the best way to do that because you don't need a sight line.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's one thing we're going to work on.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that converts the electrical energy into data, which then goes through the infrared.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, the chip that I think Ian is designing is going to be crucial.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 And really it all comes down to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 So, the components that we find here are the energy source, you know, the battery or whatever that's going to make it work.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's going to let us move the data to the receiver.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 So, you have four main components.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 And they are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there, which then brings energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the user.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 Ooh, that's not what I wanted to do.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, use that thing now that you can go back. Previous. Sorry about that guy.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's just get back to my skin out of here.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 Double click on it with the right with the left hand one.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I am.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's frozen here. Don't show me that.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 There we are. Sorry about this guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 All right, so you have your energy source, your user interface who's controlling the chip.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 The chip also uses the energy and the chip through the use of the user interface is going to control the switch, which will work your infrared bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 So, hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 This is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 And personal references, it's a fact that I can't spell.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 We need a long lasting energy source. People don't want to be changing it a lot.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 We get a straightforward interface like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 And we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so that you're not waving your remote around it and having to get frustrated and go do it by hand.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty much it for the working design.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Let's do a second.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think you can give me a similar? Yes, absolutely.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 Ready, tidy, right? Lefty, loosey, ready, tidy.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to have to do.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to have to do a second.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to work with teletext because that's been taken over by the Internet so we're not going to worry about that.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 No, no. Would you care to explain it?

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to have to do a second.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to go to page 160 on C-fax now.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to, like your question earlier, whether this is going to be for television, et cetera, just for television.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we're focused on.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Otherwise, it becomes too complex. We want to get this out very quickly.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 We only have a short amount of time.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 And finally, this is more marketing, I think.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 Our corporate image has to be recognizable.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 While we're going to make it look pretty, we need to use our color and our slogan in the new design.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 What's our corporate image like? It's kind of yellow color as well.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of a yellow and black and we have the emphasis on the R's in...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 But we put the fashion and electronics, so we've got to keep that in mind.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 So we want something that looks good.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe some buttons could be yellow. We can play around with it a little bit.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 We need to talk about our functions and our target group.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 We decide who our target group is. You, in your analysis of different marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 For example, that older people didn't really care for voice recognition, but younger people did.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, who are we ending this at?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to say that function, fashion, we put the fashion in electronics, then automatically I think, sort of younger group, that's who's going to be attracted to this.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 We also think who's going to have the money to buy that's possible.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be 25 euro, remember. So, it has to be marketable to whoever it is.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 Is it something that's going to be something that's going to be something that comes with a ton of money that's going to be marketable?

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, at least right now, what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, it would probably be sold separately.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_04
 25 euro by itself.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation, and basically, there's a big jump after 35 people don't really care if it has voice.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 So it's basically 15 to 35 that thinks that that's a good idea.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I'm going to be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age, then we would want to stick between a 15 and 35 range.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway, so that might be a fairly good target group for us.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 Now that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we going to use that as one of our functions?

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 I would say no, because it's going to have too much interest, especially if we are marketing to the people who are going to be paying the 12 and a half year list.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 To produce it? Yes.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 I want to get place for permission to do that 12 and a half year list without money to make it a couple of months.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 But what else are we going to put, I mean, not that I'm really going to tell about it, I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though, so like other than just making it look good, how is it, I mean, it can look really great, and still have the same up and down button, and why isn't I going to buy a new remote?

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 Why are we aiming for technological advancement?

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple, and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good thing to keep in mind.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 If they might be overwhelmed with the remote that have too many buttons and too much technology,

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 if someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want an upgrade?

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we can look at upgrade or we can look at user friendly. Yeah, simplification.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 It could have a crap remote that came with our TV that's just impossible to use, or maybe it broke, or maybe they're just missing it.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 And we also need to talk about if we're only going to have the very simple ones, or also have the other ones just separate somehow, or...

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 Can you like, I mean, this might be too complicated, but I wish I had someone to explain it.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 Like, if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, that had the mean buttons, and then you could pull something out kind of, and you got the rest of the buttons, but the rest of them went in. Do you know what I'm saying?

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 The remote can pull out of the side.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, like some TVs they have a slight experience on the remote control, but it's all the complicated buttons.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want to do something complicated, like on some of it, it won't be too many.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 You open up this little hat, and it slides me down in that little special buttons.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 It sends people who don't want to ever look at them, never even have to see them.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 And if you get the instruction manual that comes with it, and you just don't even read it, then you'll never even know that those things can pull out.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 And you're a happy person, and everyone else doesn't have to have, like, two remotes, one that has the easy ones, and one that has more complicated ones.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 We have to be careful that that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 But that's going to be mostly technological things.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so what are we emphasizing when in this project?

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 Simplicity and fashion.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, those are very good goals, I think, that we have to keep in mind it with everything we do.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_04
 Simplicity and fashion, and we'll use abilities, however you want to say that, which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional, so that you don't have to travel around a lot.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 What can you do to make the infrared more functional?

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 Like, why would it not be?

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a lot to do with battery, but that's just my...

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 The battery, and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 So it's just the quality of the chip?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 The quality of all the components, really.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we can't really do anything.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 Shotting work, because it's going to be visible down the line.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 So our target group, we're saying 15 to 35?

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't know how useful that number is if we're not doing...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 Which I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Like, it might be necessary for a TV, but not for the remote, you know?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_00
 Seems a little bit.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and it might be too expensive.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 And if the whole idea is you're using a remote, then why would you have a voice?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you mean, then it's like you would need a remote, you would just talk to your TV.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I think we're going to be able to pick up the mic.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe, I mean, if I get more numbers, I'll email you before the next meeting in terms of age-res.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 But this doesn't divide up anything, and there was only 100 subjects also.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 Which isn't... I mean, really isn't that representative, especially if it's 100 subjects so that they then can subdivide into age groups.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 That means that very few in each age group, so...

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think regardless, we're aiming for the understanding.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 The under 65 or something.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 Under 65.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, that's a good start.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'd say we're...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 Can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families?

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 Because that would go up to like 50...

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 Think of professionals or something.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 Like 55.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to narrow it down.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard to figure it out right now.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's hard to figure it out right now.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 But it feels impossible to write about age.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 And we've said simplicity is one of the features, so it's going to appeal to people.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe people who have problems with technology.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's a good question.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 That might be older people.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 But then we've also got fashion, which is something that definitely...

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe we don't have to define this hard group by the demographic of age.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can define it by the demographic of...

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Like how much money they have to spend or something like that.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good question.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously, that's because someone who owns a television.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 And like how recently have they bought their television?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like that sort of thing.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe it's more useful to define objectives.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_04
 Like fashion and simplicity than define a specific target group as far as age is.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 Because yeah, things will different...

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 Will appeal to different people.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:31:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, there are a couple of functions.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want something so that...

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost?

0:31:55	SPEAKER_04
 Like a button on the TV, you can press and it'll ring or something?

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 Or beep?

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I have a more 50% of the frustration someone could have.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 That was the biggest one.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 And half people said that happened.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 And we all mentioned it before we knew about it.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 And if we're talking about making it make it easy, that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 It would be relevant to like the overall goal.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_04
 We have about four minutes left to define our functions.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 So let's do that quickly.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_04
 So we want something to keep it from getting lost.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 And we want...

0:32:37	SPEAKER_04
 We want large buttons for the essential things.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 Large accessible buttons for the essentials.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 We want a possibility to get the extra functions.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_04
 And we also want it to be fashionable.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_04
 Which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a...

0:33:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Do any other essential functions that we need?

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 Battery.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 Do we need a long life battery?

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 Battery use.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 Both of them.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a good thing.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 I would imagine just because it is an electronic device.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think it does.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without one.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_02
 Or like a little cradle for your iPod.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably...

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 You could maybe do that instead.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 So you don't have...

0:34:27	SPEAKER_02
 Or like a rechargeable battery.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 That contributes to less people losing it too.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 It stays with one place.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_04
 We have to think about space in living rooms too.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 Like...

0:34:41	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, would you put it on top of the TV?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 I just think...

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, that's a good idea.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 We'll keep it.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_04
 Let's just soft it out my head.

0:34:49	None
 Okay.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we're going to conclude now.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 As everyone said, their functions.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 After the meeting, we're going to each complete questionnaire in a summer summary.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know why it's summarization.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll have our lunch break.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_04
 After that, we have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'll make sure to put the minutes in the project documentation and including this PowerPoint slides.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_04
 If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_04
 You'd have individual actions, ID, industrial design, if your components concept, user interface, the user interface concept, market trend watching.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_04
 And as per last time, you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach emailed to you.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_04
 And hopefully, I hope next time you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's kind of frustrating.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_04
 Be sure to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your in your.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_04
 Summery.

0:35:55	None
 Okay.

0:35:56	None
 Okay.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 That was good.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's you.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Did you, were you able to put yours in the group for?

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I just did that.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 Hopefully it is there for people.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like there are.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_04
 Looks like there's a second one kind of mine.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_04
 That I didn't do.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's from like an earlier project, I think so.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Where is that?

0:36:28	SPEAKER_04
 Under the shared folder.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_04
 It might not even be under here as well.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 So in there, we have technical functions, presentation, working design, presentation, and the functional requirements.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 At least that's why I'm having three.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 I just have like our three.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I have as well.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_04
 You don't have mine.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 No, but that's because I think yours is in the email separately.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's not on the server.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_01
 But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, wait.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 Never mind.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 You can't say.

0:37:02	None
 Okay.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'll figure that out in the meantime.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_04
 Alright.

0:37:12	None
 Okay.

0:37:16	None
 All right.

0:37:19	None
 All right.

0:37:22	None
 All right.

0:37:30	None
 All right.

0:37:31	None
 All right.
