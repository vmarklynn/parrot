0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_03
 So if we can't, we can.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_03
 But we're trying to make this abbreviated meeting because the next documents are pushing for it.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, gendith, according to this, is transcription status, DARPA demos, XML tools, disks, backups, et cetera, and crosspads.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_05
 Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda?

0:00:33	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_03
 We're just going order transcription status.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's probably.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to get quickly.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 I have several more transcribers and making more.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_01
 Seven?

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 Several.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 And I've been finishing up the double checking.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_01
 I hope to have that done by today, but it's going

0:00:55	SPEAKER_05
 to take one more week. As a somewhat segue into the next topic, could I get a hold of the data, even if it's not really corrected yet, just so I can get the data formats and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working?

0:01:11	SPEAKER_05
 So can just, oh, it is.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_05
 OK, just so transcripts.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 Is the sub directory?

0:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_05
 So I'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_05
 And then just we'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 I also got a shoulder mark to transcription.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_02
 I just processed the first five e-meaning since they are chunked up.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_02
 So they probably can be sent to IBM whenever they want them.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the second one of those is already at IBM.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_04
 But the other one that we're waiting to hear from them on.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 These are separate from the ones that.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 They're the IBM set.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_04
 So as soon as we hear from Brian that this one is OK, and we get the transcript back, and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching the transcripts with what we gave.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_04
 Then we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big back.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to work on that.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_05
 And so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here?

0:02:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 We're sort of doing things in parallel by way we can get as much time.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think that's the right way to do it, especially for the information retrieval stuff.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_05
 Anything else on transcription says?

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_03
 There are pedagogues where you had the sub meeting the other day.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_05
 Which, so I've been working on using the Thistle tools to do information retrieval on meeting data.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_05
 And the Thistle tools are, there are two sets.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_05
 There's a back end and a front end.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_05
 So the front end is the user interface and the back end is the indexing tool and the querying tool.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_05
 And so I've written some tools to convert everything into the right phyiformats and the demand line version of the indexing and the querying is now working.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_05
 So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for, conveniently, you can now do information retrieval on it, do type in a string and get back a list of start end times for the meeting of hits.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then what does that look like?

0:03:15	SPEAKER_04
 The string that you type in?

0:03:16	SPEAKER_04
 Are you the keywords?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 Keywords.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_05
 And then it munges it to pass it to the Thistle YR, which uses an SGML-like format for everything.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 And then does it play something back?

0:03:29	SPEAKER_05
 Right now, I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_05
 But my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_05
 So that's the other thing I want to discuss is, well, what should we do for the user interface?

0:03:43	SPEAKER_05
 We have two tools that have already been written.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_05
 The soft sound guys did a web-based one, which I haven't used, haven't looked at.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_05
 Dan says it's pretty good, but it does mean you need to be running a web server.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_05
 And so it's pretty big and complex.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_05
 And it would be difficult to port to Windows because it means porting the web server to Windows.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_05
 The other option is Dan did the Tickle TK Thistle GUI front end for broadcast news, which I think looks great.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_05
 I think that's a nice demo.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_05
 And that would be much easier to port to Windows.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_05
 And so I think that's the way we should go.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 Can I ask a question?

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 So as it stands within the channel trans-interface, it's possible to do a fine play.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 You can find a search string in play.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 So you're adding like, I don't know, are they fuzzy matches or are they?

0:04:33	SPEAKER_05
 It's a sort of standard text retrieval based.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_05
 So it's term frequency inverse document frequency scoring.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_05
 And then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_05
 How far apart they have to be in things like that.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_05
 So it's a lot more sophisticated.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_05
 It's like doing a Google query or anything else like that.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_05
 So it produces an index ahead of time so you're not doing a linear search through all the documents.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_05
 Because you can imagine if we have the 60 hours worth, you wouldn't want to do a search.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_05
 You have to do a pre-indexing.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_05
 And so these tools do all that.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_05
 And so the work to get the front end to work would be porting it, well, to get it to work on the Unix systems our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_05
 So that it understands that they're different speakers and that it's one big audiophile instead of a bunch of little ones and just sort of things like that.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 So what does the user see as the result of the query?

0:05:31	SPEAKER_05
 On which tool?

0:05:32	SPEAKER_05
 The Thistle.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_05
 The Thistle GUI tool, which is the one that Dan wrote, TIGLTK.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_05
 You type in a query and then you get back a list of hits.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_05
 And you can type on them and listen to them.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_05
 Click on them rather with a mouse.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_04
 So if you typed in small heads or something.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 You get something that will make you feel like a system audio where that's going to work.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_04
 You get a little step.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_05
 Beep.

0:05:56	None
 That was a really good look.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's too early.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 It didn't get to work.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 It didn't get to work.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_06
 Guess who I practice on.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's not what we're going to do to say what that private joke is.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 And then again, maybe not.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 So that sounds reasonable.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 My recollection of it's a pretty reasonable.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 That sounds really nice.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_05
 That sounds really nice.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be minimal effort to get it to work minimally.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_05
 And then we want to add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_05
 Dave Gilbert expressed some interest in working on that.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_05
 So I'll work with him on it.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_05
 And it's looking pretty good.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_05
 The fact that I got the query system working.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_05
 So if we want to just do a video based one, I think that'll be easy.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_05
 If we want to get it to Windows, it's going to be a little more work because the Thistle I are the information retrieval tools.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_05
 I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 So getting them to compile on Windows might be challenging.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_04
 You were saying that there's that set of tools, the signal tools.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_05
 It certainly helps.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, without those, I wouldn't even attempt it.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_05
 But what those do is provide sort of the BSD compatibility layer so that the normal Unix function calls all work.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_05
 But the problem is that the Thistle Tools didn't use anything like AutoConf.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_05
 So you have the normal porting problems of different header files and some things are defined and some things aren't.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_05
 And different compiler work around and so on.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_05
 So the fact that it took me a day to get a compile under Solaris means it's probably going to take me significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm going to run under free BSD.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_05
 Free BSD would probably be easier.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_07
 All you need to do is say to Dan, gee, it would be nice if this worked under Underconf and it'll be done in a day.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_07
 That's true.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_05
 Actually, no, I should check because he did port it to SproutCore.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_07
 So you might have done that already.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_07
 I wouldn't be surprised.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_05
 So I'll check it.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 But I would serve both purposes as you contact him and ask him if he's already done it.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, right.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 If he has, then you learn, if he hasn't, then he'll do it.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 I hope he never listens.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_05
 I've been corresponding with Dan and also with SoftSound guy, Blinking on his name.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_05
 Tony Robinson.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_05
 Do I mean Tony?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_05
 I guess I do.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_05
 Or Steve Reynolds.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_05
 Steve Reynolds.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_07
 Do I mean Steve Reynolds?

0:08:25	SPEAKER_07
 Steve Reynolds is not a soft sound, is he?

0:08:26	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_05
 My brain is not working.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_07
 I don't remember who I've been corresponding with.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_07
 Steve Reynolds wrote this whole IR.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_05
 Bennett Steve Reynolds.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_05
 So just getting documentation and format.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_05
 So that's all going pretty well.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_04
 And I think we'll be able to do this.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 So this is a playing sound file between the two platforms.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_05
 We have, well that's a good point too.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_07
 Here's a crazy idea.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, why don't you try and merge Transcriber and this will IR?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_07
 Well, this is one of the interfaces.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_05
 This is one of the reasons that I can have Dave Gilbart having him volunteer to work on I just a really good thing because he's worked on the Transcriber stuff.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_07
 And he's more familiar with that.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_07
 So Windows media playing for free.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's snack, not transcriber.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_07
 But the point is that the transcriber uses snack and then you can use a lot of the same functionality.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean, I think this will, this will gooey probably use a snack.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_05
 And so my intention was just to base it on that.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_07
 Well, my thought was, it would be nice to have the running transcripts from a speaker to speaker.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_07
 You have a speaker mark here and a speaker mark.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_05
 We'll have to figure out a user interface for that.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_07
 Well, my thought was if you had like multi-trans or whatever, do it.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_05
 It might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we'd be talking about and having the search tools and so on.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_05
 We can look into it.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_03
 But the thing I was asking about with the FreeBSD is that it might be easier to get PowerPoint shows running in FreeBSD than to get the other package running in.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean, we have to, I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 My experience with the GNU compatibility library is really, it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_05
 The Windows system isn't any harder because it looks like a BSD system.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_05
 It's just, you know, just like all of them, the include files are a little different.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_05
 The function calls are a little different.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_05
 It might be a little easier, but it's not going to be a lot easier.

0:10:37	None
 Okay.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 So there was that demo, which was one of the main ones.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 And then we talked about some other stuff which would basically be showing off the transcriber interface itself.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_03
 And as you say, maybe we could even merge those in some sense.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 But in part of that, we're showing off with the speech non-speech stuff that TLo has done.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 Looks like.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 So with the answer, you end up with somewhat prioritized.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_05
 Excellent.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_06
 So another idea I've just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to show some of the prosody work that Don's been doing.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_06
 Actually show some of the features and then show, for instance, a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_06
 You can show that graphically sort of what the features are doing.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't work great, but it's definitely giving us something.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know if that would be of interest.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 At the very least, we're going to want something illustrative of that because I'm going to want to talk about it.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 And so if there's something that shows it graphically, it's much better than me just having a bullet point pointing at something.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, you're looking at this now.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_06
 Are you looking at waves?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_06
 I'm at it.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 I'm starting to.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can probably find some examples of different type of prosotic events going

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 on. So when we hear having this demo meeting, what we're sort of coming up with is that we want to have all these pieces together the first order by the end of the month.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then that will give us a little bit of this month or next month.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, do you mean like today?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, sorry.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_06
 Next month.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_05
 Next month.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_05
 This is it.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 That will give us a week or so to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think I mean, we're not be here.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, if Don can sort of talk to whoever's because we're doing this anyway as part of our, the research, visualizing what these features are doing.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_06
 And so either might not be integrated, but it could potentially be in it.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is to an audience of researchers.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean, let's go ahead and let them know what it is we're doing.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think anyone's done this on meeting data, so it might be neat.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:12:50	None
 Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_03
 Done with that?

0:12:55	SPEAKER_05
 XML tools?

0:12:57	SPEAKER_05
 So I've been doing a bunch of XML tools where we're sort of moving to XML as the general format for everything.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_05
 And I think that's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_05
 So yet again, we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I'm not particularly happy with what we have now.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it works with transcriber, but it's a pain to use in other tools because it doesn't mark starting end of each utterance.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_05
 So it's implicit in there, but you have to do a lot of processing to get it.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_05
 And so, and also I'd like to do the indirect timeline business.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_05
 But regardless, I mean, that's something that you and me and Jane can talk about later.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 And I've installed XML tools of various sorts and various languages.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_05
 And so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files, either information on users because the user databases that way, I'm converting the key files to XML so you can extract various sort of information on individual meetings and then also the transcripts.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_05
 And so let me know there.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_05
 It's mostly Java and Pearl, but we can get other languages too if that's desirable.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_06
 Quick question.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_06
 Do we have the seat information in the key files?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_05
 The seat information is on the key files for the ones which it's been recorded.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_05
 For the new one.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_05
 Seat?

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Where you're sitting.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, not the quality, you're right.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_05
 It's pretty soft and squishy.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_05
 That might just be me.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_06
 I'm just trying to figure out, you know, when we use the keys on someone's microphone.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_06
 Are they next to him or are they crushed?

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 Where is it in the key file?

0:14:44	SPEAKER_05
 The square bracket.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_06
 Because I mean, I haven't been putting it in and you haven't been putting it in.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 I have not.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_05
 And some of these are missing, aren't they?

0:14:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 So we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, they're on the right, these, but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the key files and I don't think Chuck was either.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_06
 I never knew we were supposed to put it in.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_05
 I had told you guys about it.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 So this is why I want to use a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text, it's very easy to skip those things.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_05
 So if you use the edit key or key edit, I think it's edit key.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_05
 Command, did I show you guys that?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_05
 I did show it to you, but I think you both said no.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_05
 You'll just use text file.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_05
 It has it in there.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_05
 I placed a fill it in.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_05
 And so if you don't fill it in, you're not going to get it in the meetings.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I just realized I hadn't been doing it in probably.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_06
 So.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_05
 And then the other thing also that TLo noticed is on the microphone on channel zero, it says handheld mic or a crown mic.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_05
 You actually have to say which one.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_06
 I know.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I usually delete the.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, okay.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe I forgot to.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_06
 It's almost.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that's because.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_05
 I know.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_05
 I know.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_06
 I know.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_06
 I know.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_06
 I was like, it's Chuck's like, oh, what did Chuck do?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, I'll do that.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 And then also in a couple of places, instead of filling the participants under participants, they were filled in under description.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_05
 And so that's also a problem.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_05
 So anyway, we will do better.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, also I'm working on another version of this tool, the one that shows up here that will flash yellow if the mic isn't connected.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_05
 And it's not quite ready to go yet because it's hard to tell whether the mic's connected or not because the best quality ones, the crown ones, are about the same level if they're off or if they're on and no one's talking.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_05
 These ones are much easier.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_05
 There's a bigger difference.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm working on that and it sort of works.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_05
 And so eventually we will change to that and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mic is dropping in or out.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 That also included batteries dying?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yep, just anytime the mic's putting out zeros basically.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_05
 Now, we're off the screensaver too.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_05
 The thing is, as I've said before, it is actually on the thing.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_05
 There's a little level meter, but of course no one ever pays attention to it.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_05
 So I think having it on the screen is more easy to notice.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 It'll be nice if these have little light indicators.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_05
 Buzzer.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 Bam, bam.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 Small shocks.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's a leaf.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 Minister to the.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_05
 Dispack up the center.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_05
 I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non-backed of disk to save the overhead of backup.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_05
 And he pretty much said, yeah, you could do that if you want, but he thought it was a bad idea.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_05
 In fact, what he said is doing the manual one, doing a NW archive to copy it is a good idea and we should do that and have it backed up.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 He's a firm believer in lots of different modalities of backup.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, his point was well taken.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_05
 The state cannot be recovered.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_05
 And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup, we should have the archive.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_05
 And if the mistake is made and we lose the archive, we should have the backup.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I guess it is true that even with something that's backed up, it's not going to, if it's stationary, it's not going to go through you increment.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to burden things in the incremental.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 Just the monthly full.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 So the monthly full will be a bearer.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_05
 He said that we shouldn't worry too much about that.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_05
 That we're getting a new backup system and we're far enough away from saturation on the full backups that it's probably okay.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_05
 And so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and recording meetings.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non-backed up space for things that took less than 24 hours to recreate or something like that.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_05
 Things that are recreatible easily and also, yeah, basically, things that are recreatible.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 They expanded files and things like that.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 They take a lot more room anyway.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_05
 But we do need more disk.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_05
 So we can get more disk.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_05
 And I think I agree with him.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_05
 His point was well taken.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 If we lose one of these, we cannot get it back.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think there was any other, et cetera, there.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had done.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_07
 I thought you guys were going to burn CDs.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 Unfortunately, we could burn CDs, but first of all, it's a pain because you have to copy it down to the PC and then burn it and that's a multi-step procedure.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_05
 And second of all, the right ones, burners, as opposed to a professional press, don't last.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_05
 So I think burning them for distribution is fine, but burning them for backup is not a good idea.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 I see.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_05
 Because they, they, they all after a couple of years.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 I want to ask, I know that, that T.L., you were bringing the channel trends in your face onto the Windows machine.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's basically, it's done.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's all done.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_05
 It's wonderful.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_05
 And it runs on it basically, things will just work.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was just from with the SNEC version and the transcribed version, but it's soft.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 And that, does that mean?

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think I shouldn't have this, but I don't.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 Does this mean that this could be ported to a think pad note or is some other type of?

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, basically, I didn't install it on my laptop and, yeah, you were.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:20:31	None
 Good.

0:20:32	None
 Crosspads?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_05
 I got an email from James Landay, who basically said, if you're not using them, could you return them?

0:20:42	SPEAKER_05
 So he said he doesn't need them.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_05
 He just periodically, at the end of each term, sends out email to everyone who has recorded this having them and asks them if they're still using them.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we've never used them.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 We used them a couple times, but yeah, we have two.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_05
 So my opinion on it is, first, I never take notes anyway, so I'm not going to use it.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_05
 And second, it's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 And I have, so my feeling on it is that I think in principle, it's a really nice idea and you have the time tags, which makes it better than just taking raw notes.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 On the other hand, the downside for me was that I think the pen is really noisy.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 So you have a couple of, and I don't know if it's audible on the, I sort of thought it was a disadvantage.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 I do take notes, I mean I could be taking notes on these things.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 And I guess the plus, the crosspads would be the time markings, but...

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 What is it, crosspads?

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a regular pad, just a regular pad of paper, but there's this pen, which indicates position.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 And so you have time and position stuff stored so that you can, you have a record of whatever it is you've written.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_05
 And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_05
 So if you take notes, it's a great little device, but I don't take notes.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because we were interested in higher level things, not just the microphone stuff, but also summarization and so forth in the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what was it that happened in the meeting, where would it come from?

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that was one of the things, right?

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 And so it seemed like a neat idea.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well have a scribe, have somebody take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_03
 And then we did it once or twice.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yep, and I'm just sort of dying out.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 I've been chose to write, but...

0:22:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 But I guess the other thing I'm thinking is we wanted that kind of thing.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 I wonder if we lose that much by having someone be as scribe by listening to the recording afterwards, taking notes.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 I mean we're transcribing it anyway.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's summary.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_06
 I think there's also, there's this use that...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_06
 Summarize it from the transcript.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_06
 Well what if you're sitting there and you just want to make an X and you don't want to take notes and you just want to get the summary of the transcript from this time location like, you know, and then while you're bored you don't do anything in once in a while.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe there's a joke and you put an X.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_06
 But in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_06
 Also with, I was thinking, I know Morgan disagrees with me on this, but suppose you have a group in here and you want to let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not want to distribute in terms of content.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_06
 They could just sort of make an X near that point or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_06
 So I know we haven't been using it, but I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods, would you then get back in a transcript?

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 So what makes one thing is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later and put some kind of summary or something, you know, to be some scribe who would actually listen, who would agree to actually listen to the whole thing, not transcribe it, but just sort of write down things that struck them as important.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_03
 But then you don't have the time reference that you have if you had it live.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_06
 And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be...

0:24:29	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that's part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time, the cross-pads.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 So that means synchronizing the time, you know, you want to pretty close and there's a form on a skew because it's a handheld unit with a battery.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_05
 And so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used so that it's synchronized with the time on that.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_05
 And then you have to download to an application and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you want to do anything with this information.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_05
 And so there's a lot of infrastructure which...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_05
 There is an alternative.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, still, you know, your point stands about there being need to be an infrastructure, but it doesn't have to be synchronized with a little clock timer on it.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 When I did it, I synchronized it by voice by whispering 1, 2, 3, 4 into the microphone.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_05
 Well, but then there's the infrastructure at the other end, which someone has to listen to that and find that point and then mark it.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_06
 Well, could we keep one of these things for another year?

0:25:35	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, is there a big problem?

0:25:36	SPEAKER_05
 We keep up.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_06
 Just in case we...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_06
 Just in case we...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_06
 Even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate...

0:25:44	SPEAKER_06
 There's a bunch of things that might be neat to do, but it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and do all the infrastructure, but we can at least try it out.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, one thing that we might try is on some set of meetings, some collection of meetings, maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else, we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, part of the reason...

0:26:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in the speech quarter sort of idea from the beginning is he set the beginning, he had you taking notes and so forth.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 And Jane is more into it, but I don't know if you want to really do this all the time.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the thing is to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 And if so, it's probably worth having one.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 The problem with the more extended view, all these other, you know, with equibbling about particular applications of it is that it looks like it's hard to get people to routinely use it.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it just hasn't happened anyway.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe if we can get a person.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I don't think it has to be part of what everybody does in a meeting, but it might be a useful, neat part of the project that we can, you know, show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time that happen that you just want to make a note of, like what Jane was talking about, with some later browsing just as a convenience, even if it's not a full-blown note-taking substitute.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_07
 If you wanted to do that, maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_07
 And that way you can synchronize very easily with the meeting because you'll be synchronized with the Linux server.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_06
 And so what kind of input would you be?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_06
 So, I mean, if you're not worried about it.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_07
 You just be pressing like, well, you have a PDA and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, you'd have to do a little bit of coding to do it.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_07
 But you could imagine, I mean, if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note-taking channel, but just sort of being able to use markers of some sort, a PDA with a lot of wireless card would be probably the right way to go.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, even buttons you could do, sort of, I mean-

0:28:00	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, for what you've been describing buttons would be more convenient than anything else,

0:28:04	SPEAKER_06
 right? That would be fine too.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I don't have, you know, grandiose ideas in mind, but I'm just sort of thinking, well, we're getting into the next year now.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_06
 We have a lot of these things worked out in terms of the speech.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe somebody will be interested in this.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 I do like, if you have a couple buttons where one button was, oh, another button was that's great.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_06
 Or like, this is my, I'm supposed to do this kind of button.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_06
 I better remember it.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_06
 Action item.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, something like that or.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think the cross-border idea is a good one.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that it's been a lot of extra work for me.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's also, it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a digital record, too,

0:28:53	SPEAKER_05
 isn't it? Well, it's digital, but it's in a format that is not particularly standard.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 If you're writing notes in it, it can't do handwriting recognition.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, but it's just storing the pixel information, information, it's how digital.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 I guess what I'm thinking is that the PDA solution, you have it already, without needing to go to pixelization to that.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_07
 The transfer function is less errorful.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_06
 Well, and also it's maybe realistic because people are supposed to be bringing their PDAs to the meeting eventually, right?

0:29:27	SPEAKER_06
 That's why we have this little, I don't know what I don't want to cause more work for anyone, but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_06
 And so if we don't have to return it and we can keep it for a year, I don't know.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_05
 We certainly don't have to return it.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_05
 As I said, all he said is that if you're not using it, could you return it if you are using it, feel free to keep it?

0:29:48	SPEAKER_05
 The point is that we haven't used it at all, and are we going to?

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 So we have note, I would suggest you return one.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Because we haven't used it at all.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Why would probably-

0:30:00	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe we could do like a student project, maybe someone who wants to do this as their main project for something would be cool.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_05
 And if we had them out and sitting on the table, people might use them a little more.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are there any incidents and meetings and press a button when somebody laughs?

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah, that's not a bad.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_06
 Jeremy is going to be- he's a new student starting on modeling breath and laughter, actually, which sounds funny, but I think it should be cool.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_05
 Sounds breathy to me.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_05
 Ha-ha.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_05
 Ha-ha.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_05
 Oh dear.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_05
 Um, that reminded me of something, oh well, too late.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_05
 It flipped out.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_05
 Are you going to tease me?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm always going to do that.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_05
 We ordered more wireless, and so they should be coming in at some point.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_05
 And then at the same time, I'll probably rewire the room as per Jane's suggestion, so that the first end channels are wireless, are the closed talking in the next stand, are far-field.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 You know what he means, but isn't that funny, something?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 We ordered more wireless.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's like wires are the thing, so you're ordering- you're- you're- you're- we ordered more absence of the thing.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_06
 That's a very philosophical- It's sort of an acronym, am I right?

0:31:18	SPEAKER_06
 That's great.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_05
 Should we do digits?

0:31:21	SPEAKER_05
 Do we have anything else?

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, there's all this stuff going on between Andreas and- and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_03
 Recognition runs trying to figure things out about the features, but it's all sort of in process, so it's not much to say.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Right now.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 When we start with our esteemed guest.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_07
 All right.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_05
 So just a transcript number, and then the-

0:31:53	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, this is number two for me today.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 The idea to do is go away to move way up and-

0:31:57	SPEAKER_06
 You can do simultaneous. Initiate him.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_06
 Should we do simultaneous?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I'm just thinking, are you going to try to save the data before this next group comes in?

0:32:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, we might want to do a simultaneous.
