0:00:00	None
 Okay.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_04
 How we placed in terms of...

0:00:05	SPEAKER_04
 You're okay.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I should probably try to see up straight.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 Like that?

0:00:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think mine's falling off.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to start this PowerPoint real quick.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 Very official.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of like this.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 I'm kind of getting into it.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, just to kick off the meeting basically.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 So we're working for a real reaction.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 And this is...

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 Just got an agenda to set out what we're going to try to accomplish in this particular first meeting.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Then we're going to talk a little bit about tool training.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet, the whiteboard.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_00
 We've got a general plan for the project, how we're going to go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion to close up.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 IRL, I guess, you know, gamers lying in real life.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, I want to...

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to...

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Of course we can discuss that.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 I'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, if you say something about marketing, right, sort of.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to believe you can hook up from there.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you guys...

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 At the same time, if you logically, if something doesn't look like a comic, we're going to sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 You say, well, that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, go with it and we'll discuss it.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm not going to ask, do you know that?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 It seems like...

0:02:40	SPEAKER_00
 Prove it.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Because we're sort of role-playing.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to tap into your own knowledge as well.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 And that's the same for when we do introductions.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, and you talk about your background.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 You know, have fun.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you went to...

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 You know, maybe you're like me and you went to UCSB, but you want to say you went to Harvard or something like that.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you can...

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we can have a little bit of a phone with it.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 So, are you guys okay with that?

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Does that seem logical?

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 It works for me.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 It works for me.

0:03:12	None
 It works for me.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, I guess we're totally...

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 We're making a remote control, which is thrilling.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 But the idea is that we can make something...

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 Based on the whole corporate motto, I don't know if you guys had time to check the...

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 In your life.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you guys would check the corporate website.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 We've got to make something as fashionable as possible.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's kind of the corporate strategies.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like John Lewis, nicer, you know, if you go to Devanems or something.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically, we are reinventing the wheel, but we want to try to do it in a user-friendly, slick, sleek kind of way.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 What we're going to go about doing that is basically, at first, we're going to start on the basics.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 And that's where I'm going to need you guys to use your interface designers and the other designer that I can't remember the idea, the idea, the industrial designer.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 Hey, I'm not getting into it.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 To guide me and guide us on this project, because you're going to be...

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 You guys are the bottom.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you can't do that.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 You can't have X and Y at the same time.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 And then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like...

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think you guys probably got the same email as I did, but the idea of, yes, a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 But it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass, so that if you touch it, you hurt your hand or something like that.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 And so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it. And then finally, we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 You know, what you guys build or tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what...

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 And what way to go, take the basics and make it nicer.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 And then obviously, the UID and the ID, you know, you can keep on, you know, cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible to make it easier.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_00
 To try to sync it all up. So that's a detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so for now, just for the whiteboard, basically, just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to start and carry like five remotes around.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 And just write down, I'm just going to write down one of the names of my desert discs.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 You know, if you were trapped on a desert island and you can only bring five CVs along with you, name one of them that you could.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_00
 Not all five. If you want to write all five, go for it. But name one of them that you could.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm an excellent project manager. I'm Marty.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 I went to uni at UC Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a PhD in psychology.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so...

0:06:19	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Sarah. I went to Michigan and I'm here in cultural studies and I'm a marketing manager or something, marketing expert.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 Don't play yourself down. That's me.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Ron. I once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the user interface designer.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Nathan. I'm from California and I'm here doing a master's screen in social anthropology.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 What did you go to uni at UC?

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 No, I'm really cool. My little brother goes there.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so desert island discs.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to wait for you to write it down or you're going to tell us?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'll just get a couple of them down. See, I'm a big music fan. I don't know if you guys are.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 I'm assuming everybody likes music because it's some lesser, greater extent.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 But there's some other options. If you're a TV slut like I am, like small, terrible television show, but I happen to love it.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's rubbish, but I love it. I went to high school with Tom Willing, actually.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 The main guy. Wow. Is he a wanker? Yeah.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 Very much so. I love a soccer player, but a total bastard.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 He looks really tall. He's got to be like six seconds. He's a big guy.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys heard Jeff Buckley?

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's cool because not very many people have.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well, I might as well throw a British person in there.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 You can't go wrong with radio head.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 Can you call?

0:07:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so it really works just like a panel and it makes noises, I think.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of weird. Anyway.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you like pressing your...

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 You'll see.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 Alright, so whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess I'll go next next.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right on.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we lose all my mics plugged in here. Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 This is basically just pen practice, huh?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Oh, you're much taller than me, so I'm going to write down here.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right now I'm listening to a lot of...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Somebody never heard of Chris Bathgate, local Michigan, folk singer.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 Nice.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 Really lame.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 And what else did I bring with me?

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 Probably classical, the total leaky.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think...

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 And my family guy DVDs.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_00
 We don't need to write that one down.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, family guy.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_00
 Do you watch the new season?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 Are you getting it online or is it on the sky?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm going to start downloading it, yeah.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 That'd be nice.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm just going to put down one...

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 One CD.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Anybody?

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm afraid not.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 Afrobeat orchestra.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Very cool.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Afrobeat orchestra.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Very cool.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 They like 15 members from Brooklyn.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 Exciting.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Supposed to be across the center.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 Thing I love about Enra.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't even read those.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 I should admit that.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 They're designed specifically to ignore.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's brilliant.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's the five by five.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 I can't read that much.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Ah, yes.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, okay.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 I see that.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 Vomit.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 Streetteats.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 That's so brilliant.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's so horrible.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen more urine in this city than ever before.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 Seriously.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 But I just came from Glasgow and I'm happy to say that there's more vomit.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 There's the same quantity, approximately.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's so mean.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 It really is.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_00
 Does...

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 Ready?

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Mingen.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going local.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going local.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 I have to be here for three years.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to look at the terminology, right?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 I've already got more than I can keep track of.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to go home next week and everyone's like, oh my God.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 You're trying to get into one of those.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_03
 Have you been home yet?

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 They'll be like, say something British and you're like, oh, shut up family.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it should be interesting.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know that one.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Are you going to stay here?

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Probably.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 Better religion?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Some music I grew up listening to.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I can think of so many other ones.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah, that's why.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 That's how it works.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 Something I miss about my hometown.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 I miss coffee.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 Doritos.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Doritos.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 I cost less than...

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Two bucks.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 Anything that are like...

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 Where are you from in California, by the way?

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 I grew up in San Diego, but...

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 Did you really?

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 What part?

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 La Jolla, P.V.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm from San Diego as well.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 Beachy.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, really?

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 I last lived in San Francisco having lived in Cal.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I have lived in Southern California since I was 18.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Going to North Cal, I'm sorry.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 You just can't get a bit of bread over what's available in San Diego.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's different because in San Diego, the tortillas are cooked on the grill and then throw the California de steamed.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 It must make all the difference.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it really does.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 There's other things too.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 You just can't place it.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 Like, when I went to school in Santa Barbara, which is Central California, the Mexican food is okay.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's just not good.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Like...

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, it's like two bucks.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 Like, literally two bucks for this massive...

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 Good call on that.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you from in San Diego?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 Just literally just metropolitan San Diego.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 I live like five minutes from the zoo.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, North Park, actually, if you want to get real...

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, my grandparents lived on 32nd.

0:12:15	None
 Yep.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Clust, you know, where a clardoline coffee shop is.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 On university.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually like literally half a mile from my house.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, pretty cool.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 Small world.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 As we were discussing before, especially when we're all from the same general region.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 Success on the whiteboard.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 There you go.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 You can harness the awesome power a little bit of interactions.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 We talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think we'll...

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, moving on to not fun stuff.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Project finance.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, what we're trying to do is sell this remote for 25 euros.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 This is what the finance department has told me, the CFO.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 But, I don't know.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sold on this.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty dear.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that's like, you know, 40 bucks for remote.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, we can maybe work on that later.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 But, we're going to make a lot on it.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 We have profit names to make 50 million euros on it internationally.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, one of the things that I was going to mention to you guys, the designers, is that we probably need a...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 It needs to be a universal remote control probably.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Like if it's going to control DVDs.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, I'll leave that to you guys.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 But that's something that is going to be an international sold thing.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 But, we want to try to make it for 1250.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So, we want to try to make 100% profit on it if we can't.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used the next time, right?

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 Project manager, sort of.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 We'll meet in another half an hour or so.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 And, I'd like the industrial designer to think about what needs to be done.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Like what the basic function of it.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 You ID...well, yeah, your assignments are up there.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 And you'll also get assignments from in your email as well.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 More specific on what to do.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, so, I mean, do you tell us what the user's going to want?

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, actually, in a way, you guys maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's going to want and what the user can have.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 You'd go and shape that.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, it is when we'll discuss the trade-offs in between.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 And so, yeah, specific instructions will be sent in your email.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 But, I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 And as more things come up, we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Any questions before we get started?

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that we're building a standalone remote control.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 We can't kind of build it into other products.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 You mean, for instance, like a mobile phone.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm, that's interesting.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think there's any rules about it yet.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you're a personal coach.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Or, you know, can we sell a remote control phone for 25 pounds, you know?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 Well, have a think about it.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, okay.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm certainly open.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 It seems like, yeah, it seems like it's certainly doable, isn't it?

0:15:29	SPEAKER_00
 Or if we can't have a full mobile phone, maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 The clap.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 No, good idea.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 Good idea.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Every mode with changeable faces, like face-to-face.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 I like that.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 I like that.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Hot.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we probably have some time.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we want to do.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'll go back to, um, I don't really have any.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 Project announcements.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 Not so much.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 All right, we'll find that we're on our own.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Now, are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 Let's do it.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Does anybody have any initial ideas?

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to go ahead and take notes on this too, because...

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Good idea.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 Start two minutes.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, I don't remember.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, initial ideas.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's pretty much given it's going to be universal.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 We decided that already.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 And it may be functioning for other things.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 As soon as you said that, I was thinking like all the other things you get in remote too, like your microwave or your front door, like, to have everything on one thing.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_03
 But then, never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't do.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 Smaller is better.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 Simple.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking...

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 Specific.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking kind of PDA, uh, design, so touchscreen design, rather than...

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_01
...but also that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that slick, isn't it?

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, like stylist.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, we got five minutes more to chat about that.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_00
 That's perfect.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between, um, size and functionality.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 And we also...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
...month multifunctional, but at the same time, if you get it to do too much, you're not going to be able to tell them apart.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be too complicated.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's a crowded button, some things.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 I'm also going to note for future reference, this idea of, um, so you, like, remember, I can, like, a touchscreen type of remote?

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Possibly.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think one of this.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it should be an option.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 It needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the different relates.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, all the other universal remotes.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 Um, I don't know if there's such thing out there.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we'll do some research on it or one of us can do some research on it about whether or not there are, um, multi-format.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_00
 Like, um, you know, PAL, NTSC, Region 1.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty sure there is.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I have a friend who has a PDA.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 That he just points at his tel- any television he wants, and it'll figure out the specifications of it and we'll control it.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 Awesome.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that that can be done with going around the world.

0:18:45	None
 Okay.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Um, all right.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm liking that idea, this idea of a touchscreen remote with multi-format features.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 Um, right.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 Um, let's see.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think making it out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it'd be nice and slick would be important.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 That adding this whole, like, PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to be careful of what, like, just something like, keep in mind, we start actually dealing with this stuff, but that would be really cool.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I like the idea of the multi-plate.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 What do they call those faceplate things?

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 They're named as... Are they?

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 I like...

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to come up with a fuzzy one as well.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Lumbercraven.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 Lumbercraven.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a locator device.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 But if we're bundling it, unless we're selling their tele with the remote.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if we bundle it as a phone, then you can always call it.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 True.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 If you're not doing that, then we can have something that just kind of rings from either...

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there used to be those whistling devices, but that's a little bit annoying.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Could we not do something where like just a little... Like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote?

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 That you can place somewhere else that you press and it makes the remote page.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_00
 Kind of like how on a lot of cordless regular phones you have a page button that goes, right?

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Could we do something like that?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's cool.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think we could design that.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:20:52	None
 Um...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think this material quality as well, like I guess we can think about what kind of...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 You know, Apple has been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of...

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and that titanium, the new silver sleek ones, the last couple of years.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's pretty much so.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 Curves.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we do have the minimum amount.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we were talking finances, I don't know, selling a 40-pound remote, or a 40-dollar remote, 25-year-old remote would be pretty...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it's pretty expensive.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we might want to trade off some of the features for a lower price.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Without getting in about a whole, like, you know, go down to bargain store remote, you know, bargain store universal remote that's black and, you know, massive, some kind of... I don't know, a balance there in somewhere.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 But, um, have a think about what we can do, have a think about what we want to do, how we're going to sell it.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 And our users in mind, like these...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 Grammies are not going to be into this whole new...

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 Let's design the modes, the buttons.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to, and who we're going to be able to get it out of it.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's true.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking 25 pounds or 25 euros.

0:22:04	None
 25 euros.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's a slight difference, I guess.

0:22:10	None
 Yeah.

0:22:11	None
 They're all weaker than... they're all stronger than the dollar.

0:22:14	None
 Although, computer parts.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, if you can upgrade your computer by the time you're in a computer, you can't get it.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 They're all weaker than... they're all stronger than the dollar.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 Although, computer parts.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, if you can upgrade your computer by the states.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Like, do you guys know Fries?

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Huge computer electronics store?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 They serve... or they say, yes, they will sell things overseas.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_00
 So you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like 23 pounds, like that.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 So if you guys need a reminder about what we've talked about on the different trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas, you can consult them at your leisure.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 And right, so thanks for that.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just head back to work on what we were talking about.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 Getting into...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 You have an hour?

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 Perfect.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:23:19	None
 Thanks for watching.
