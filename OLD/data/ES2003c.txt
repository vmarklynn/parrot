0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right, yep, I just have a quick overview of the minutes.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think to sum up the last meeting would be to say the requirements that we've set out.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 We were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick, LCD and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being, let's suppose, one of the main single purpose buttons.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 We were also going to use a novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter of any luck, the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design, it looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control of any luck.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty much sums up the last one.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just crack on.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 Like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see today is the conceptual design phase and it's to cover things like what the parts might be made of, can we outsource these from elsewhere, what we have to construct the items ourselves.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 I have a presentation area, I'll just say that in the, yep, okay, I'll just award the upman.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Which one?

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, interface concept.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's you.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 We've got trend watching.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 Components design.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 So the case, that's for the role.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 First of all, it could be plastic or plastic.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_03
 So later on, we found out that it can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 So it's probably plastic.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 We need the infrared transmitter.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 Get that off the shelf.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 Joy-Sick will probably, if we're going to use it, could be plastic or rubber even as well.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 If you go on to the next slide, if you go on to findings, it's two or three slides there.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_03
 So this is what a family can use.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Three different types of batteries can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones that they use in watches or else.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_03
 Solid power.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 No, the kinetic one.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's the ones where like you, the movement causes it.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_01
 The battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power would be my one query.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power?

0:03:51	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think watch moves around a great deal more?

0:03:56	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it would.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 And solar cells, I don't know about that.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 Been inside and all, yeah.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 You should probably just use conventional batteries.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 Just like a new one can cause.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again, you too?

0:04:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 These are two different types of shapes.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 You can have one as a flat one.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then more original ones are single curved one with a double curved.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 And the materials are there as you can see.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 But you can't have a titanium one for a double curved.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 The titanium, they're really strong metal.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is it also expensive?

0:04:48	SPEAKER_03
 It thinks so as well.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm curious.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if he'd be able to off the top of your head or not.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 The single curved with double curved.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 We could be able to give an example.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 Could you maybe draw something?

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to be perfect.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's just because I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 For curved, well I was thinking to sit in the palm of your hand.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe like this with the joy pod here.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do I stick here?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe an okay button around here so that the thumb can use it quite easily.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 But don't exactly double curves.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 The problem means this is probably double curves.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas a single curve would be like that.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:05:53	None
 Or not.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 So it might literally just be two curves.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas this is two curves.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess that's what they mean by double curve.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 It looks better than a single curve.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 You can't have it in titanium.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 A nice material.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 For the buttons, you can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouse.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit more expensive.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to use LCD, it's a little more expensive.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 So you can decide to trade off there.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 If you want the buttons to be, if you have a double curve, control and it's rubber, then you have to use rubber buttons as well.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to have to have a number keypad for the amount of channels these days.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels together when you want to.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 You want to enter just a number if you know.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we're going to have to have a number keypad anyway.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think?

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to have to make sure that we can talk about it.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 So you've got a little bit about the chip that we might require as well.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_03
 So it depends where you're going to spend the money.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to fancy LCD display.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any idea so far when we're saying that we need an advanced chip for an LCD, does that shoot the cost up by a drastic amount or?

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 You need an advanced chip for the LCD.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think compared to say with pressing of buttons.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 Advanced light.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 If you press a button and it sends a certain transmission through the infrared, whereas if we're controlling the LCD, we definitely require a much more powerful chip.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think see.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 If I've not overstepped.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 Should I go on or go for that?

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 If we only have 12 pounds 50.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 12 euros, not even 12 pounds.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 12 euros was that like 8 pounds or something like that.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'd also be relying on the bulk buying and produce and such.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 I assume we have to look into the cost of those.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 So sorry.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 The previous slides just explain what the internal components of the control.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 If you don't want to be further.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it just says what it does.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 Translate the key press into the infrared signal and this is received by the TV.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 The chip just needs to detect the key press and then it's added to the amplifier.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 And then the next slide shows the copper wires interact with the buttons to get sent to the chip.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 So that's just how the power works inside.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's a side on what buttons are they use.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 You just got a section of the press.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 So in the information that you've been supplied, how feasible would you say that the idea of using an LCD looks?

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can do it if we use conventional buttons and not have solar cells, they're connected.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then maybe use a single curved case because you might need to be curved for the film to use the joystick easily.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 And then you'll need the advanced chip for the LCD.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 I mean that sounds like a good requirement to me.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 Conventional battery would seem to make sense.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't know about anybody else but plastic or rubber is a traditional format casing would seem to be a good way forward.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm actually going to be a golden go street for rubber.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 I also have a preference for rubber.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 First of my reasons.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we move on to user interface and...

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, as long as we use...

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 And I'll...

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 And interface concept.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to have to work between the slides and the whiteboard because I actually have some fairly concrete things.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's time.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 I was given an HTML file giving various ideas from other previous remote control designs and pretty much decided to just dump them off.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 I wasn't very impressed by them and I didn't seem to...

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that were going for today.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 So rather than looking at other remote, it would be better to simply look at the human hand and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 So the finger is...

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 Each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide, please.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 And what we've basically decided on was the joystick two function buttons and the LCD.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_02
 Just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 I don't actually think we need the numeric keypad because one of the menus that we could have available via the LCD is one where you scroll through channels.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 So if there's something...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 Bear in mind, since this isn't meant to work for...

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 For digital or for cable or whatever, you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels and then the channel for your VCR and R DVD player and R set top box.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not really excessive to the inside of that.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_02
 Because I have two modes, basic mode where the joysticks left right for channels up down for volume and the menu mode for further functions.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 The reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design, it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 Can I jump in slightly there?

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 That would suggest that double curve design is probably going to be most appropriate then.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, absolutely.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 Basically what I...

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 Basically what this would be having, I would say the whole thing articulated at two points.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 So if you're handing it from a left or right handed, you can adjust it so that the LCD and the joystick could be in the right place.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_02
 Also this is a rather nicer design gimmick that the whole thing should have sort of organic feel to it because it should be soft to touch and can be moved around.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 Onto the next slide.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Just to let you know, we'll probably be quite tight for time as well.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say I guess.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I can add pretty pictures to this.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Assuming the hand to be in a sort of disposition, not holding the remote, the joystick unit should rest up with the joint of the forefinger.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 So it's directly visible for the thumb.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 And it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 You just have two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can end the upper part, one for the forefinger, one for the middle finger.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 This part here is the joystick.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 This would be the actual grip, probably where you don't have the battery as well.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 That would be probably the bulkiest part.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 And you then have at the bottom the LCD and this would need to be articulated as well.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 And basically I'd want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist so it would fit just nicely in the hand.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 And again, this part could be rotated so it can...

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 So the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 And then the bottom function button switches between modes.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 Now, programming it...

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, this is one thing I found with the replacement remote control.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 Programming them can be a right pain.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I thought that the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm fairly simple software on the computer just so that you could program it in a rather more comfortable interface.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 And you could download programs for TVs from all the main manufacturers.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Though it would be necessary to have a mode for programming it without the computer.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 Just in case there are still people left out there who don't have them yet.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's my idea.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent, right?

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 So to gather my research to be basic methods, we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff, or they want it to look cool.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 And then we researched our fashion trends in Europe.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 What's the new black, you know, as it goes?

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Next slide, okay.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_00
 We found in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they wanted to be cool.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 And they wanted to do a lot of good stuff.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 They wanted to look like it does a lot.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_00
 And if it does do a lot, that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, you know.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 They want it to be...

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds a bit like a contradiction.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 Technically, technically innovative.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 People want it to be that, but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 So like the interface is really important.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_00
 And easy to use.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 It just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the second point is twice as important as the third point.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 People want it...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be cooler than easy to use, you know, if it has the newer speeches, even if it's difficult to use, to prefer it to have the newer speeches.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 And if it's easy to use, that's a bonus.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 The fashion now, this seems better to me, but fruit and bears is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 I had that relates to a remote control, I don't know.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 But I see, I come onto that in the next slide.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 Spongy.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 I've always been saying everything is the new black.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, spongy is the new black as well.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 So we had the choice between rubber and plastic.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 If it's a type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then that's good for it.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_03
 I mentioned that the rubber material is the type of stress ball material.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Not just normal rubber.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so kind of spongy material.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 So my personal opinion, we want some advanced internet technologically innovative, obviously.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 What we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 That's different, you know, that's everyone has a white remote control, black remote control.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 You need something cool.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_00
 Like titanium is cool, but it's expensive.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Now the fruit and veg options.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 Even we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the research did come up with fruit and veg, so maybe it is important.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's up to the interface guy.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_00
 So if we stay away from it, you know, stay away from it.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 But if we're going to go along with it, then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 There can be something like, I say potato peeler, but I'm sure you guys have a much cooler idea than I do.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 So I think cool is the key.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 A few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe they were.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, back in the day when they first come up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 Sturdy, you know, for being stronger, sturdy.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 So if we want something stronger than sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titanium.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 But if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't matter. Spongy material is not going to break.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_00
 I just don't know how the LED and the lights are going to fit into a spongy material because it's not going to be completely squeezable.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 So how do things fit in? And if we are going to use spongy, we can say it's long lasting.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it's damage resistant and stuff like that.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 So just to summarize, people want stuff that's cool, that looks like it's cool.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 And if it is cool, it's a bonus where there doesn't have to be people like Fruit and Veg.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 People like spongy material, if we're going to use spongy material, we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote that idea.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 So this was this year. So things change all the time, every year, you know, they always talk about this year.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 This is a new black. Well, next year, something else is going to be the new black and we're stuck with last year's Fruit and Veg type stuff.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. That's me.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead than most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs. So if we can get next year, then that's possibly a good place to start anyway.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 Seems like a lot of the components could be off the shelf. So I don't know exactly what cost would be incurred. I can see your point about the numbered key back.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 If you need to do traversal of a large number of channels, my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of set boxes as well.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 And you should be LCD and a joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, if you've got a lot of channels, the numbered key back can be quite annoying as well because if you're trying to remember what numbers the discovery child is.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good point. You can incorporate names into different.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 But if you have a menu structure, then you can subgroup them.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 Say something like lithium ion battery, the kind that you find in most small hand-held devices now.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like we're going for a double curve design. I don't know what cost implications there are in that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 So I'd have to say, depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I would say definitely.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, the idea of having it articulated, there would be basically two points of articulation.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 One below and one above, the main sort of grip.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think there's any way we can maybe remove the articulation?

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 I can see why it looks appealing, but it could be a weak point in the structure, do you think?

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 That would be a worry of mine.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 If you're going with the fruit and vegetables, it looks like a banana.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 I don't want to sign it that way.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it would be a structural weakness.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if you have a firm substructure, you can then incorporate articulation into that.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 If you then have other outer skin of flexible, spongy rubber, then you have something very much organic.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think it would look rather cool.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, drawing there doesn't do it just as it makes it.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 It makes it look a little bit more like a vibrator than a remote control, but we won't add that functionality.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 One interesting point is I don't know how serious you were there, but if we take some of the ideas of a banana, why don't we make the damping yellow to incorporate the color of the logo?

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's certainly a different color from your average...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 You make it harder to lose, as well.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Was there anything in your research?

0:26:39	SPEAKER_00
 The noise for when you lose the banana.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but when you lose the remote control, it could be like a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard B.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 You lose the monkey, the banana.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 You lose the banana, you press the button, and you hear like monkeys scream to someone like that to direct you towards the banana.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable, though we have monkeys default.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I was going to talk about the programmable remote control.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be cool if you had one remote control that can work with all TVs, you know, you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 But why you'd need to program it like as a standard feature?

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, basically, the...

0:27:31	SPEAKER_02
 For...

0:27:33	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, each manufacturer will have a particular command set that the TV responds to.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's not simply a matter of frequency.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, usually what's done is you have a big booklet full of different possibilities.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 You'll have all of them sort of programmed into the...

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
...remote and you'll have this little booklet of codes.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 You then find your...

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
...find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name until you find the right one.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's because televisions, they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 But if we had some sort of hookup to your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer, you can avoid that rather irritating.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it for one of the options they have, is it the lookup, the name of the company on the LCD, and then maybe look up different names of different actual units that have been produced.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 Or we have the little control, just go through them until it's like, does a Stufa correct function and such?

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 booklet.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Some pages.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 I just think if we were to store this information, some type of mapping, this person probably need to use this feature like once.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 When they first buy the remote control, whenever they buy a new television.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, once every-

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's not to be used very often, that's right. Yeah.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 But it's a nuisance.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 And it's a nuisance very close to the, to actually purchasing it.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's something you're likely to be thinking about.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 If there's one in the shop that says it can avoid much of that nuisance, you might be favorably inclined towards it.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this is just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty sure that you've got that anyway.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 This was a conceptual one.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've covered everything we need to here.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've decided on standard items for most of them, rubber and such.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're now looking at the detail design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, for example, we'll just start the talk.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_01
 But yourself and the industrial and designer are going to be working quite closely at this stage because it'll be hard not to, obviously.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 Looking for a prototype thing of some of the description using clay.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as progress.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 The user interface design.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like the idea of push forward so far is maybe more of a physical one now, or possibly be more interested in maybe how the LCD is going to incorporate, you think?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 Or do you perceive that most of the design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout?

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think other than getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, most of the sort of layout design decisions are made, I would say.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, the menu structure to a considerable extent is going to vary according to the model of television and also any customizations that the user might wish to incorporate.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, one of the nice things about having an LCD and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 That's very true.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 I've got product evaluation as well.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, see, some of these things kind of logically follow the others.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 How can product evaluation doesn't that come after?

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 Have you seen any product prototype?

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be more case of how do you envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with?

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's true.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, it would be a case of do you think that just bringing users in, do you have them test out?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places, which I suppose is quite similar, or just kind of hitting the streets and saying, this is a new remote control, what do you think it will look at it?

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_00
 So, at this stage, we still have an old target audience.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of, say, maybe 60 or something, with the address.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 The reason I'm saying that is that we're just looking at a replacement remote control, something that's stylish.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe you're even just, maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying, it's nervous.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 If they're buying it that often, or they're maybe looking to replace something, then they've got a bit of free cash, so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe even single, just for the reasons of excess cash flow.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, I mean, at 25 euros, I don't think we're looking at charging the air for the device.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a lot of the best way to do that, as well as the normal bracket.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Your idea of a USB, I think, would largely depend on the cost.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 The USB is definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there, but it might push the cost of the overall unit up, because we require not just the connection, but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 That one would have to be based on the USB approach for the remote control.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 The idea was that maybe it could connect tops for allowing a software interface in the PC for a larger programming, due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice, easy, minimal design normally.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely broken some type of...

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 But didn't they just say it was just for TV?

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's just for TV, but for different programming it to use your TV, you might hook it up to the PC.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the USB might be prohibitive, but we don't know unless it would make sense to.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_00
 But you're going to need some type of flash memory or something.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, something that doesn't...

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 You wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it would need to have...

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 It would need to have some sort of onboard memory in any way.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 For one thing, I do think the menu system should be...

0:35:00	SPEAKER_02
 Although it's not going to be terribly complicated.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's just controlling one device, the menu system ought to be customizable.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_00
 Different languages and different schemes and stuff like that.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 How you want to say the menu structure for looking through channels, if you've got lots of channels.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_00
 If it was customizable, it's in different languages and stuff.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_00
 It is supposed to be international, right?

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 It would make sense to you.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 It would make sense to you.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 And we'd better be careful at the time as well.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody had a five minute warning, so...

0:35:43	SPEAKER_01
 I would say international would make sense.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to look at product evaluation.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'd better start writing up the hell of a lot of crap.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to look a bit more at the physical makeup.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like we're going to need to maybe prototype and play.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see how that goes.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 We'll be supplied with the clay as well.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_02
 Where is the clay?

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 We'll go with the fashion thing.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_03
 The fruit and veg.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's a spongy, it's over.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would be my idea.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think I would largely not have to ask you to clear the whole fruit and veg.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_02
 But the spongy, I like it a lot.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 I have quite a general consensus that the idea of the rubber could be quite...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you're wondering about having bright yellow.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could have options for colors as well.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 And again, it has the advantages of being harder to lose.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_00
 We are trying to promote a remote control, but we want to keep the company brand as well.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 So we always need to remember that somewhere we're getting the slogan on.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 Possibly, I'm not sure, but I'm seeing a little bit of space around the joystick area, which could be used.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_02
 Like I said before, I think we should have the RRR on the top function.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that says it all really.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to throw it to it.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see everybody in a half hour.
