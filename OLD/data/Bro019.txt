0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 We're on.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_06
 24th?

0:00:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 Joggy's a mic, wireless?

0:00:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_02
 Wireless headset?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for you at this.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too hot, not too cold.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_06
 They were far enough away that you got more background noise and so forth, but they weren't so close that they got quite the really good.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_06
 They didn't, I'm saying the right, they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mics.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_06
 On the other hand, they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference, so it didn't seem to be a good point to them.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_06
 On the other hand, if you only had to have one mic in some ways, you could argue that lapel was a good choice precisely because it's in the middle.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_06
 There's some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with lapel, little mouth clerks, and breaths, and so forth.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_06
 They're worse with these than with lapel, but given the choice, we, there seemed to be very strong opinions for getting rid of lapels.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 You mic numbers.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 Your mic number is written on the back of that unit there?

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 And then the channel number is usually one less than that.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's one less than what's written on the back.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 So you should be zero actually.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_06
 Or your channel number.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_06
 You should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 So what we usually do is we typically will have our meetings and then at the end of the meetings we'll read the digits.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody goes around and reads the digit session.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 The bottom of their form.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Our 19?

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 Our 19.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we're a succession of our 19.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_06
 If you say so.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, do we have any kind of agenda?

0:01:52	SPEAKER_06
 What's going on?

0:01:55	SPEAKER_06
 I guess...

0:01:56	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:01:57	SPEAKER_06
 So they'll see here for the summer, right?

0:02:00	SPEAKER_06
 So one thing is to talk about a kickoff meeting maybe.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_06
 And then just, I guess, progress reports individually.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_06
 And then plans for where we go between now and then pretty much.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 I could say a few words about some of the compute stuff that's happening around here.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 So the people in the group know.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_06
 Why don't you start with that?

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we just put in an order for about 12 new machines to use as sort of a compute farm.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 And we ordered to send blade 100s.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm not sure exactly how long it'll take for those to come in.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 But in addition, we're running...

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 So the plan for using these is we're running P-Make and Customs here in Andreas has sort of gotten that all fixed up and up to speed.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 And he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to run things using P-Make and Customs.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 You don't actually have to write P-Make scripts and things like that.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 The simplest thing.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 And I can send an email around or maybe I should do an FAQ on the website about it or something.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_03
 But an email that points to the FAQ.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 There's a command that you can use called Run command, Run-Command, Run-Hipin command.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_03
 And if you say that and then some job that you want to execute, it will find the fastest currently available machine and export your job to that machine.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 And run it there and it'll duplicate your environment.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_03
 So you can try this as a simple test with the LS command.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 So you can say Run-Command, LS, and it'll actually export that.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 LS command to some machine in the institute and do an LS on your current directory.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 So substitute LS for whatever command you want to run.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_03
 And that's a simple way to get started using this.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 And so soon when we get all the new machines up, then we'll have lots more compute to use.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 Now one of the nice things is that each machine that's part of the P-Make and Customs network has attributes associated with it.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 Attributes like how much memory the machine has, what its speed is, what its operating system.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 And when you use something like Run-Command, you can specify those attributes for your program.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if you only want your thing to run under Linux, you can give it the Linux attribute.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 So you can control where your jobs go, to some extent, all the way down to an individual machine.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Each machine has an attribute, which is the name of itself.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 So you can give that as an attribute and it'll only run on that.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_03
 And if there's already a job running on some machine that you're trying to select, your job will get queued up.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 And then when that resource, that machine becomes available, your job will yet exported there.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 So there's a lot of nice features to it and it kind of helps to balance the load of the machines.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_03
 And right now, Andreas and I have been the main ones using it.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_03
 And where the SRI recognizer has all this P-Make custom stuff built into it.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_06
 So as I understand here, he's using all the machines and you're using all the machines.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, exactly.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you know, I sort of got started using the recognizer just recently and I fired off a training job and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying, are you running two trainings simultaneously?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 My jobs are not getting run.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I had to back off a little bit.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 But as soon as we get some more machines, then we'll have more compute available.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 So that's just a quick update.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 What we've got.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_05
 I have a question about the parallelization.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_05
 So let's say I'm like a thousand little jobs to do.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_05
 How do I do it with run command?

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 You could write a script, which called run command on each subjob.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_03
 But you probably want to be careful with that because you don't want to saturate the network.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 So you should probably not run more than say ten jobs yourself at any one time.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Just because then it would keep other people.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's not that so much as that, you know, if everybody ran 50 jobs at once, then it would just bring everything to a halt and people's jobs would get delayed.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 So it's sort of a sharing thing.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 So you should try to limit it to sometime, some number around ten jobs at a time.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 So if you had a script, for example, that had a thousand things that needed to run, you'd somehow need to put some logic in there.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 If you were going to use run command to only have ten of those going at a time, and then when one of those finished, you'd fire off another one.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_06
 I remember I figured whether it was when the Rutgers or Hopkins workshop, I remember one of the workshops I was at there where I was really excited because I got 25 machines and there's some kind of p-make-like thing that sent things out.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_06
 So all 25 people were sending things to all 25 machines.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_06
 And things were a lot less efficient than if you just used your own machine.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, exactly.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 It was a very cool thing.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you have to be a little bit careful.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_03
 But you can also, if you have that level of parallelization, and you don't want to have to worry about writing the logic in a Perl script to take care of that, you can use p-make.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you're basically right to make a file that, you know, your final job depends on these one thousand things.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 And when you run p-make on your make file, you can give it the dash capital J and a number, and that number represents how many machines to use at once.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it'll make sure that it never goes above that.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not systematically queued.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, all the japs are running.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 If you launch 20 japs, they're all running.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_04
 It depends.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you run command that I mentioned before, doesn't know about other things that you might be running.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 So it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 And they wouldn't know about each other.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 But if you use p-make, then it knows about all the jobs that it has to run.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it can control how many are runs simultaneously.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_06
 So run command doesn't use p-make?

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 It uses export under-lyingly.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 But it's meant to be run one job at a time.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 So you could fire off a thousand of those.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 And it doesn't know any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_06
 So why would one use that rather than p-make?

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if you have, like for example, if you didn't want to write a p-make script, and you just had an HTK training job that you know is going to take six hours to run.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 And somebody's using the machine you typically use.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can say run command and your HTK thing.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 And it'll find another machine, the fastest currently available machine, and run your job.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_06
 Now does it have the same sort of behavior as p-make?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_06
 Which is that, you know, if you run something and somebody's machine, they come in and hit a key, then it's...

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yeah.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 There are...

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 So some of the machines at the institute have this attribute called NOEVICT.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 And if you specify that in one of your attribute lines, then it'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 But the machines that don't have that attribute, if a job gets fired up on that, which could be somebody's desktop machine, and they were at lunch, they come back from lunch, and they start typing on the console, then your machine will get evicted...

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 Your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine automatically.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 So which can cause you to lose time, right?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 If you had a two hour job and you got halfway through, and then somebody came back to their machine and got evicted.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 So if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted, then you give it that minus the attribute, you know, NOEVICT.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 And it'll pick up a machine that it can't be evicted.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_06
 What about...

0:10:08	SPEAKER_06
 Remember, it was used to be an issue, maybe it's not anymore, that if you...

0:10:13	SPEAKER_06
 If something required...

0:10:14	SPEAKER_06
 If your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things around it, so you could work, but if you were logged into it from home, and you weren't hitting any keys because you were home.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not sure how that works.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like Andreas did something for that.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we can ask him.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know whether monitors, the keyboard, or it actually looks at the console, TTY, so maybe if you echoed something to the...

0:10:40	SPEAKER_06
 You probably wouldn't door it in early though, you're right.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_06
 You probably wouldn't order it in early.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, you're sort of...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_06
 You're at home and you're trying to log in, it takes forever to even log in, and then you probably go screw this.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not sure about that one.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 I knew a little orientation about this environment and how to run some jobs here, because I never did anything so far for these exhibitions.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I'll ask you after the meeting.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and also, Stefan's a really good resource for that feature.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'm sure.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 Especially with regard to the Aurora stuff.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 He knows that stuff better than I do.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_06
 Well, when we...

0:11:27	SPEAKER_06
 Sinales and Sier...

0:11:29	SPEAKER_06
 I'm been one of these.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_06
 That one, you tell us what's up with you.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_06
 Which would be not bad, hopefully.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, shall I start from...

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, how...

0:11:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I think I'll start from the post...

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 Aurora submission maybe.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, after the submission, what I've been working on really was to take other submissions and then...

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
...over their system, what they submitted, because we didn't have any speech and enhancement system.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 So I tried...

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
...and...

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
...and then I found that...

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
...when you were combined with LD8, you used a form of movement over there.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Are you saying LDA?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, LDA.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 So just the LDF filters.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 I just plug in...

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 I just take the capsule coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LD on top of that.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 But LDF filters that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 What I did was I took the LDF filters designed using clean speech.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 Mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of using this...

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
...narrow band LDF filters that we submitted, I got new filters.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 So that seems to be giving...

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
...improving over their system slightly, but not very significant.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 And that was...

0:13:29	SPEAKER_02
...showing any improvement over...

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
...finally by plugging in an LD8.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 And so then after that I added the online normalization also on top of that.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 And there also, I found that I have made some changes to their time constant that I used.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 Because it has a mean and variance update time constant, which is not suitable for the enhanced speech in whatever we tried on the proposal one.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 But I didn't play with that time constant a lot.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 I just found that I have to reduce the value...

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 I mean I have to increase the time constant or reduce the value of the update value.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 That's all I found so I had to...

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and the other thing what I tried was...

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 I just took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint information.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 Just the Aurora baseline to see that how much the baseline itself improves...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
...by just supplying the information of the speech and non-speech.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 And I found that the baseline itself improves by 22% by just giving the...

0:14:40	SPEAKER_06
 I can back up a second.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_06
 I missed something.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_06
 I guess my line wondered that when you added the online normalization and so forth...

0:14:49	SPEAKER_06
...things got better again.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_06
 No, no, no.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 Things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_06
 No, no, with a different time constant.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 With a different time constant, I found that...

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
...I mean I didn't get an improvement over not using online normalization.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, I didn't.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because I found that I would have to change the value of the update factor.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I played with...

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
...play quite a bit to make it better than...

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 So it's still not with online normalization didn't give me any improvement.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So I just stopped there with the speech announcement.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing what I tried was adding the endpoint information to the baseline...

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
...and that itself gives like 22% because the second...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
...the new phase is going to be with the end-pointed speech.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 And just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change...

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
...by adding this endpoint information.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 So people won't even have to worry about doing speech non-speech.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what the feeling is like.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 They're going to give the endpoint information.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_06
 I guess the issue is that people do that anyway.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_06
 Everybody does that.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I wanted to see given that you're doing that...

0:15:56	SPEAKER_06
...what are the best features that you have.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_06
 I see.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:16:00	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, clearly they're interact.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_06
 So I don't know that I entirely agree with it.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_06
 But it might be...

0:16:05	SPEAKER_06
 In some ways it might be better to...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_06
...rather than giving the endpoints to have a standard that everybody uses...

0:16:11	SPEAKER_06
...and then interacts with.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_06
 But, you know, it's still something reasonable.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 So are people supposed to assume that there is...

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
...are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints?

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 Or can you then...

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, that's not.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 So I think each outside of it for estimating background noise.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 I guess that is what the consensus is.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 You will...

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 You will be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 But the whole speech is available to you.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_06
 So should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
...because you don't have the mistakes.

0:16:45	None
 Yeah.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 So that...

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 That baseline itself...

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it improves by 20 to 1.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 And I found that in one of the speech that carcases...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
...proves by just 50% by just putting the endpoints.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 And you don't need any speech in answer.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 So the baseline itself improves by 50%.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, by 50%.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so it's going to be harder to...

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 Big that actually.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 So that is when the qualification criteria was reduced...

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
...from 50% to something like 25% for well-matched.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think they have actually changed the qualification criteria now.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah, I guess after that...

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
...I just went home for...

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 I just had a vacation for...

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_06
 That's good.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_06
 That's good.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I came back and I started working on...

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
...some other speech enhancement algorithm.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, so from the submission...

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
...you are found that people have tried to...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
...spectral subtraction and venerable filtering.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 These are the main approaches...

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
...what people have tried.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 So just to...

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
...just to fill the space with some few more speech enhancement...

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
...algues them to see whether it...

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
...I've been working on this...

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
...signal subspace approach for speech enhancement...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
...where you...

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
...take the noise-y signal and decompose into signal...

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
...and the noise subspace...

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
...and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal person...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
...nois subspace.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 And so I've been actually running some...

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
...so far I've been trying it only on MATLAB...

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
...to test whether it was first or not.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'll put it to see...

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
...then update it with the repository once I've...

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
...finally giving you some positive result.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_06
 So you said one thing...

0:18:27	SPEAKER_06
...I wanted to jump on for a second.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_06
 So now you're getting tuned into the repository...

0:18:32	SPEAKER_06
...thing that he has here and so we'll have a...

0:18:35	SPEAKER_06
...simple place for this stuff.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_06
 It's cool.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe just briefly...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_06
...you could remind us about the related experience...

0:18:44	SPEAKER_06
...because you did some stuff...

0:18:45	SPEAKER_06
...you talked about last week I guess...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_06
...where you were also combining something...

0:18:50	SPEAKER_06
...both of you I guess we're combining something...

0:18:52	SPEAKER_06
...from the telecom system with...

0:18:55	SPEAKER_06
...I know whether it was system one or system two...

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
...it was system one.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_04
 So the main thing that we did is...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
...just to take the spectrosuppraction from the front silicon...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_04
...which provide us some speech samples...

0:19:12	SPEAKER_06
...that are with noise removed.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_06
 So let me just stop you there.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_06
 So then one distinction is that...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_06
...you were taking the actual front telecom features...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_06
...and then applying something...

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 No, there was a slight difference.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
...I mean, these are extractors at the handset.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because they had another back end blinding...

0:19:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but that's what I mean.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_06
 Sorry, I'm not being clear.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_06
 What I meant was you had something like Kepstra or something.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_06
 And so one difference is that I guess you were taking...

0:19:46	SPEAKER_06
...spec graph.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_04
 But I guess it's exactly the same thing...

0:19:50	SPEAKER_04
...because on the handset they just...

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
...applied the Wiener filter...

0:19:55	SPEAKER_04
...and then compute Kepstra features.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the Kepstra...

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
...the difference is like...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
...there may be a slight difference in the way...

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
...because they use exactly the baseline system...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
...for computing the Kepstra once you have the speech.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 If we are using our own code...

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
...that could be the only difference.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 But you got some sort of different results...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_06
...I'm trying to understand that.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think we should...

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
...have a table with all the results...

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
...because I don't know...

0:20:22	SPEAKER_04
...I don't exactly know what are your results.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but so we did this...

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
...and another difference, I guess, is that we just applied...

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
...properse our one system after this...

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
...with our modification to reduce the delay of the ADA filters.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 And other slight modifications...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_04
...but it was the full proposal one.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 In your case, you tried...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
...only a little bit...

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
...just putting it the ADA and maybe...

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
...on the optimization.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 After that, I don't know the situation.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 So we just tried directly to...

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
...just keep the system as it was.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 And...

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
...when we plug the spectra-attraction...

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
...it improves significantly.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 But what seems clear also is that...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
...we have to retune...

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
...the time constants of the online organization...

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
...because if we keep the value that was submitted...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
...it doesn't help at all.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 You can remove online organization...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
...or put it, it doesn't change anything.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 As long as you have the spectra-attraction.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 But you can still find...

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
...some kind of optimum somewhere...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
...and we don't know where exactly.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 So it sounds like...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_06
...you should look at some tables of results...

0:21:42	SPEAKER_06
...or something and see where...

0:21:44	SPEAKER_06
...where they were different when we can learn from it.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 Without any change.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we change it.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 We have to have...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
...alie filters.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_04
 There are other things that we...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
...finally were shown to improve.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_04
 So like the 64-hz cutoff...

0:22:18	SPEAKER_04
...it doesn't seem to hurt on TI digits, finally.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe because of other changes.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there are some minor changes.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 And right now if we look at the results...

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
...it's always better than...

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
...it seems always better than the French Telecom for mismatch.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_04
 I mismatch.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 And it still slightly worse for well-matched.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 But this is not significant.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 But the problem is that it's not significant.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 But if you put this in the spreadsheet...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
...it's still worse, even with very minor...

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
...even if it's only slightly worse for well-matched.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 And significantly better for HM.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 But well, I don't think it's important.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because when they will change their mid-track...

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
...mainly because of when you plug the frame dropping...

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
...in the baseline system...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_04
...it will improve a lot HM and MM.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess what will happen?

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what will happen.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 But the different contribution I think for a different test set will be more...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 But the well-matched may still...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
...I mean, the well-matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 So the MM and HM are going to be hugely affected.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 But everything is like...

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
...that's how they reduce the qualification to 25% or something.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_06
 But are they changing the waiting?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, I guess they're going ahead with the same rating.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_06
 I don't understand that.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_06
 I guess I have been part of the discussion.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_06
 So it seems to me that the well-matched condition is going to be unusual.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_06
 In this case, unusual.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_06
 Because you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any particular person's car is like.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_06
 Or it seems like something like the middle one is more natural.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_06
 So I don't know why the well-matched is...

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but actually the well-matched...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, the well-matched condition is not like the warning PI-Tits where you have all the training conditions exactly like replicated in that testing condition.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 Also, this is not calibrated by SNR or something. The well-matched has also some mismatching match.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_06
 The well-matched has mismatch.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 Also some slight mismatches.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Unlike the PI-Tits where it's perfectly matched because it's artificially added now.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 But this is natural recording.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_06
 So remind me of what well-matched you've told many times.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 The well-matched is defined like it's 70% of the whole database is useful training and 30% of the full testing.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 So it means that if the database is large enough, it's matched.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 Because in each set you have a range of conditions.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_06
 So I mean, yeah, unless they deliberately chose it to be different, which they didn't because they wanted to be well-matched.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_06
 It is pretty much so it's sort of saying that you're in heat though.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_06
 It's not guaranteed.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 Because the main reason for the mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_06
 Again, if you have enough, if you have enough.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_06
 So it's sort of like if you're saying, okay, so much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer, you have a car.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_06
 And so you drive it around a bunch and record noise conditions or something.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_06
 And then I don't think that's very realistic.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_06
 I guess they're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially, that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars and you would have something that was roughly similar.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe that's the argument, but I'm not sure I'd buy it.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_06
 So, well, it's gone.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we are also playing in trying to put other spectrosuppraction in the code.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_04
 It would be a very simple spectrosuppraction on the male energies, which I already tested, but without the frame dropping actually.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 And I think it's important to have frame dropping.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Is it a spectrosuppraction typically done on the after the male scaling or is it done on the FFT bands?

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 Does it matter?

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know. Well, both cases.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, some of the proposes, I were doing this on the FFT bands, others on the male energies.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 You can do both, but I cannot tell you which one might be better.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 I guess if you want to reconstruct the speed, it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bands.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 But for speech recognition, it may not be very different if you do it on male warmth or whether you do it on FFT.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_02
 So, you're going to do a linear waiting anyway after that.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it gives something different, but I don't know what are the pros and cons of both.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing is, when you're putting in a speech enhancement technique, is it like one stage speech enhancement?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Because everybody seems to have two stages of speech enhancement and all the proposes, which is giving them some improvement.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, they just do the same thing again once more.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 And so, there's something that is good about doing it, when cleaning it up once more.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it might be. So, maybe in my implementation, I should have so tried to inspire me for this kind of thing.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_06
 Well, the other thing would be to combine what you're doing.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe one or the other things that you're doing would benefit from the other happening first.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_06
 So, if he's doing a signal subspace thing, maybe it would work better if you'd already done some simple spectrosituaction or maybe the other way around.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, the thing about combining the Venerful drink with signal subspace, just to see some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_06
 How is, I guess I'm ignorant about this.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, since Vener filter also assumes that you're adding together the two signals, how is that different from signal subspace?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. The signal subspace approach has actually an inbuilt Vener filtering in it.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it is like a KL transform followed by a Vener filter.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay. So, it definitely has the K.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 I see. It's very poorly with that. It's very bad for SNR conditions and in colored noise.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_06
 So, essentially you could do a simple spectral subtraction followed by a KL transform followed by a Vener filter.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's a cascade of.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and generally, that's right. You don't want to authorize if the things are noisy, actually.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_06
 That was something that, here Vener, we're talking about with the multi-band stuff, that if you're converting things to from bands, groups of bands into capture co-efficient, you know, local sort of local capture co-efficient, that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's one reason maybe it would combine.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Something to improve SNR a little bit. Yeah. First stage and then do something and the second stage it should take it.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if you're prompt about, about the color noise.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the colored noise. The color noise, the signal subspace approach has, I mean, it actually depends on inverting the matrix.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's the co-edits matrix of the noise. So, if it is not positive definite, when it has it, it doesn't behave very well, if it is not positive definite.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_02
 It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_06
 So, the spectral subtraction had noise.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering first of the colored noise and they make the noise white.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then finally when you reconstruct the speech back, you do this filtering again.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_06
 I was only half-caring. You sort of do this spectral subtraction that also gets through.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_06
 And then you add a little bit of noise, noise addition. I mean, that's sort of what J-Rest it does in a way.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_06
 If you look at what J-Rest is doing, essentially it's equivalent to adding a little noise.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_06
 Or you get rid of the effects of noise.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so there is this. And maybe we find some people also that agree to maybe work with us.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 And they have implementation of VTS techniques.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's a vector autolo series that are used to model the transformation between clean capstras and noisy capstras.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 So, well, if you take the standard model of channel plus noise, it's a non-linear transformation in the capstras domain.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 And there is a way to approximate this using first order or second order telor series.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_04
 And it can be used for getting rid of the noise and channel effect.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_04
 Who is doing the working in the capstras domain?

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, there is one guy in Granada and another in Lucent that I met at ICASP.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_06
 Who is the guy in Granada?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 José Carlos Segura.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 This VTS has been proposed by CME.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Original date was from CME.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's again a different thing that could be tried.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. Yeah, so anyway, you're looking general, standing back from it, looking at ways to combine one form or another of noise removal with these other things we have.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_06
 Looks like a worthy thing to do here.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_04
 But for sure, let's re-check everything else and re-optimize the other things.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 For sure, the online normalization may be the LDA filter.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it seems like one of the things to go through next week when Harry's here because Harry will have his own ideas to, I guess, not next week, week and a half.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_06
 We sort of go through these alternatives, what we've seen so far and come up with some game plans.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_06
 So, I mean, one way would...here's some alternate visions.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, one would be you look at a few things very quickly.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_06
 You pick on something that looks like it's promising and everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_06
 Another thing would be to pick two plausible things and you know, have two working things for a while until we figure out what's better.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_06
 But, you all have some ideas on that too.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing is to most of this speech and management techniques have reported research on smaller capital rate assets.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 But we're going to address this Wall Street Journal in the next stage, which is also going to be in our seat.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at home.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, there are some...I was looking at some literature on speech and management apply to large vocabulary.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 Speical subtraction doesn't seem to be the thing to do for large vocabulary.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 There are always people who have shown improvement with linear filtering and maybe subspace up whichever special subtraction you have.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_02
 But, we have to use simple spectrum to make it...how to do some optimization.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_06
 So, they're making...somebody's generating Wall Street Journal without it or artificially out of knowing or something.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_06
 Sort of like what they do with TI digits.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_02
 I guess, I guess, the inter-fascism.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_06
 And then they're generating HTK scripts.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I know that there's no...I don't know whether they have converged on HTK or using some...

0:36:52	SPEAKER_06
 It's a Mississippi State, maybe.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so that'll be a little task in itself.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_06
 Well, we've...yeah, it's true for the additive noise.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_06
 Artificial added noise, we've always used smoke vocabulary too.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_06
 There's been noisy speech, the style of artificial vocabulary that we've worked with in broadcast news.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_06
 So, we did broadcast news evaluation and some of the focus conditions were noisy.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_06
 But we didn't do spectrosotraction.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_06
 We were doing our funny stuff.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_06
 We were doing multi-stream and so forth.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_06
 But, you know, stuff we did helped.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, it did something.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_06
 Now, we have this meeting data, the stuff we're recording right now.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_06
 And that we have for the, the quote-unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_06
 It's the far-failed mic.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_06
 And we have the digits that we do at the end of these things.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_06
 And that's what most of our work has been done with that, with connected digits.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_06
 But, we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech, like vocabulary continuous speech, using switchboard, so a switchboard recognizer.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_06
 No training from this, just plainly switched words.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 But, this is the switchboard thing that's what we're doing.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_06
 Now, there's some adaptation though that Andreas has been playing with.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_06
 But, we're hoping, actually Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point, not that distant future trying some of the techniques that we've talked about on some of the electrical vocabulary data.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I guess no one has done, yet done test one on the distant mic using the SRR recognizer.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_06
 How did I know of it?

0:38:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_06
 It's a very scared.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_06
 I see a little smoke coming up from the CPU.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_06
 You were trying to do it.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_06
 But, yeah.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_06
 But, you're right.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_06
 That's a real good point, that we don't know what, if any of these, I guess that's what they're pushing that in the evaluation.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_06
 But, it's good.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_06
 Anything else going on?

0:39:15	SPEAKER_06
 From the day of the century?

0:39:16	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have good results with the, including the new parameters, I don't have good results.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_01
 Are similar or a little bit worse?

0:39:27	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so you probably need to back up a bit, so.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter, the catch-strong coefficient, that like the autocorrelation, the R0, and R1 over R0, and another estimation of the variance of the difference of the spectrum of the signal, and the spectrum of time after the filter bank.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, I should have.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, you have the spectrum of the signal, and the other side you have the output of the filter bank.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_01
 You can extend the coefficient of the filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_01
 I do the difference.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_01
 I found the difference at the variance of this difference, because we think that if the variance is high, maybe you have noise.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_01
 If the variance is small, maybe you have a speech.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_01
 The idea is to find another feature for discriminating between voice sound and voice sound.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_01
 We try to use this new feature.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_01
 I need to change the window size of the analysis window size to have more information.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_01
 This is the 2.5 milliseconds.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_01
 I did the time of experiment to include this feature directly with the other feature, and to try to use a neural network to select voice and voice silence and to concate this new feature.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_01
 The result with the neural network, I have more or less the same result.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it's worse, sometimes it's a little bit better, but not significant.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_02
 Is it with the IDG?

0:42:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, I work with the Italian and Spanish, basically.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_01
 If I use the neural network and use directly the feature, the result are worse.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_01
 But listen, Harry.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_06
 I really wonder, though.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_06
 We've had this discussion before, and one of the things that struck me was that about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that whenever you condense things in an irreversible way, you throw away some information.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_06
 That's mostly viewed as a good thing, the way we use it because we want to suppress things that will cause variability for a particular phonetic units.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_06
 But you do throw something away.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_06
 The question is, can we figure out if there's something we've thrown away that we shouldn't have?

0:43:20	SPEAKER_06
 When they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank, I was thinking, oh, they're picking on something, they're looking on it to figure out noise or voice property, whatever, that's interesting, maybe that helps to drive the thought process of coming up with the features.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_06
 But for me, the interesting thing was, well, but is there just something in that difference, which is useful?

0:43:46	SPEAKER_06
 So another way of doing it maybe would be just to take the FFT, power spectrum, and feed it into a neural network.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_06
 And then use it in combination or alone or whatever.

0:43:58	SPEAKER_00
 With what target?

0:44:00	SPEAKER_06
 No, we need to. No, just the same way we're using the filter bank.

0:44:09	SPEAKER_06
 Exactly the same way we're using the filter bank.

0:44:11	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it's good, but it's different.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe if it's used in combination, it will get at something that we're missing.

0:44:21	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe using KLT or adding probabilities, I mean, all the different ways that we've been playing with, that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that's useful that we're missing here.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there's so much variability in the power spectrum.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_06
 Well, that's probably why it would be unlikely to work as well by itself, but it might help in combination.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_06
 But I have to tell you, I can't remember the conference, but I think it's about 10 years ago.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_06
 I remember going to one of the speech conferences and I saw within very short distance of one another, a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired friend end or something.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_06
 And a couple posters away with somebody who compared one to just putting in the FFT and the FFT did slightly better.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_06
 So I mean, it's true there's lots of variability, but again, we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that variability and doing something reasonable with it.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_06
 So it's the same argument that's gone both ways about we have these data driven filters, LDA, and on the other hand, if it's data driven, it means it's driven by things that have lots of variability and that are necessarily not necessarily going to be the same in training and test.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_06
 So in some ways it's good to have data driven things in some ways it's bad to have data driven things. So part of what we're discovering is ways to combine things that are data driven and are not.

0:46:04	SPEAKER_06
 So anyways, it's just a thought that if we had that, maybe it's just a baseline, which would show us what are we really getting out of the filters, or maybe probably not by itself in combination, you know, maybe there's something to be gained from it.

0:46:21	SPEAKER_06
 And let the, what, you know, you've only worked with this for a short time, maybe in a year or two you would actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information, but maybe the neural net and the HMMs could figure it out quicker than you.

0:46:36	SPEAKER_06
 So it's just a thought.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_02
 I will try to do that. Yeah. But one one one one thing and so like what before we started using this VAD name is earlier. What we did was like I guess most of you know about this adding this additional speech silence beat to the kept stream and training that you want that.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_02
 That is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the speech that color is a lot of. But not much on the TIT. So adding an additional feature to this discriminated between speech and not.

0:47:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry. We actually added an additional binary feature to the kept stream just the baseline.

0:47:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but in the case of the idea that they actually he was anything because there was anything that could discriminate between speech.

0:47:28	SPEAKER_02
 But what Italian was like.

0:47:31	SPEAKER_02
 Very good. The huge improvement.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_04
 But in the question is even more is within speech can we get some features.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_04
 I was dropping information that can might be useful within speech and maybe to distinguish between voice sound and voice sounds.

0:47:46	SPEAKER_06
 And it's particularly more relevant now since we're going to be given the end points. So.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:47:56	SPEAKER_06
 So.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_02
 So it was a paper in I guess this I guess about the extra adding some higher order information from the kept stream coefficient.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a chemilins or something.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_02
 It was taking the.

0:48:32	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:48:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think he was showing a person something on.

0:48:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but again, you could argue that that's exactly what the neural network does.

0:48:51	SPEAKER_06
 So the neural network is in some sense equivalent to computing higher order moments.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_06
 So let's do it very specifically.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_05
 You want to talk about.

0:49:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:49:22	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:49:24	SPEAKER_05
 I told you I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam.

0:49:27	SPEAKER_05
 So basically that's just trying to propose.

0:49:32	SPEAKER_05
 You're following years of your PhD work trying to find a project to define and work on.

0:49:40	SPEAKER_05
 So I've been looking into doing something about speech recognition using acoustic events.

0:49:49	SPEAKER_05
 So the idea is you have all these these different events.

0:49:53	SPEAKER_05
 For example, voicing.

0:49:55	SPEAKER_05
 Faciality are coloring.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_05
 Building robust primary detectors for these acoustic events and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_05
 And these primary detectors will be inspired by multi band techniques doing things similar to Larry Saul's work on graphical models to detect these acoustic events.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_05
 And so I've been thinking about that and some of the issues that I've been running into are exactly what kind of acoustic events I need, what acoustic events will provide a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_05
 And also once I decide a set of acoustic events, how do I get labels training data for these acoustic events.

0:51:06	SPEAKER_05
 And then later on down the line, I can start playing with the models themselves, the primary detectors.

0:51:14	SPEAKER_05
 So I kind of see like after after building the primary detectors I see myself taking the outputs and feeding them in sort of tandem style to to a Gaussian mixture of HMM back end and doing recognition.

0:51:34	SPEAKER_05
 So that's just generally what I've been getting at.

0:51:39	SPEAKER_06
 But by the way, the voice down voice version of that for instance could tie right into what Cameron was looking at.

0:51:46	SPEAKER_06
 So you know, if you if a multi band approach was helpful as I think it is, it seems to be helpful for determining voice down voice might be another.

0:52:01	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, it looks okay. Yeah, and so this this past week I've been looking a little bit into traps and doing doing traps on these events too.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_05
 I'm seeing it that's possible. Other than that, I was kicked out of my house living there for four years.

0:52:33	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah. So that was cardboard box on the street now. Something like that.

0:52:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:52:39	SPEAKER_02
 So did you find a place? No, I ordered. Yesterday I called up a lady who will have a vacant room from May 30th and she's actually been doing to more people.

0:52:59	SPEAKER_02
 So she would get back to me on Monday. That's that's only thing I have. And Diane has a few more houses. She's going to take some pictures and send me after I go back.

0:53:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so you're not down here permanently yet? No. I'm going back to a GI today.

0:53:17	SPEAKER_06
 Okay. And then you're coming back.

0:53:21	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I planned to be here on 31st. 31st. Okay. There's a house available.

0:53:26	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I mean, if they're available and they'll be able to get you something, so worse comes to worse.

0:53:31	SPEAKER_06
 We'll put you up in the hotel for a while until you.

0:53:36	SPEAKER_00
 If you're in an investment situation, you need a place to stay. You could stay with me for a while.

0:53:40	SPEAKER_00
 I've got a spare bedroom right now.

0:53:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, thanks.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe he needs.

0:53:50	SPEAKER_05
 My car board box is actually a bedroom.

0:53:56	SPEAKER_06
 Two bedroom car board box.

0:54:01	SPEAKER_06
 That's great.

0:54:08	SPEAKER_06
 You want to say anything about you actually been last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre.

0:54:14	SPEAKER_06
 You were mentioning is that something worth talking about here?

0:54:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't think it directly relates. Well, I was helping have speech researcher named Pierre Devenny.

0:54:26	SPEAKER_00
 And he wanted to look at how people respond to formative changes, I think.

0:54:35	SPEAKER_00
 So he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel to vowel transitions.

0:54:40	SPEAKER_00
 And then he wanted a psychoacoustic spectrum.

0:54:46	SPEAKER_00
 And he wanted to look at how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum.

0:54:53	SPEAKER_00
 And compare that to the listener tests.

0:54:56	SPEAKER_00
 And so I gave him a PLP spectrum.

0:55:01	SPEAKER_00
 And he wanted to track the peak.

0:55:04	SPEAKER_00
 So he could look at how they're moving.

0:55:06	SPEAKER_00
 And then he took the PLP LPC coefficients.

0:55:11	SPEAKER_00
 And I found the roots.

0:55:13	SPEAKER_00
 This was something that's defied and suggested.

0:55:16	SPEAKER_00
 I found the roots of the LPC polynomial to track the peaks and the PLP LPC spectrum.

0:55:23	SPEAKER_02
 Is that a line spectral pairs?

0:55:26	SPEAKER_06
 It's root LPC.

0:55:30	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of the log, you took the root square, you could be good or something.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_06
 So it's taking to find the roots of the LPC polynomial.

0:55:38	SPEAKER_02
 Polynomial.

0:55:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, is that the line spectral?

0:55:40	SPEAKER_06
 So it's like line spectral pairs.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_06
 I think what they call line spectral pairs, they push it towards the unit circle, don't they?

0:55:47	SPEAKER_06
 But what we'd used to do, when I did synthesis at National Semican Bacter 20 years ago, the technique we were playing with initially was technique LPC polynomial and finding the roots.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_06
 And it wasn't PLP because he didn't invent it yet.

0:56:01	SPEAKER_06
 But it was just LPC and we found the roots of the polynomial.

0:56:05	SPEAKER_06
 And when you do that, sometimes, there are most people that call formats, sometimes they're not.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_06
 So it's a little, a format tracking with it could be a little tricky because you get these funny values.

0:56:18	SPEAKER_06
 So you just get a few roots, two or three.

0:56:22	SPEAKER_06
 You get these complex pairs.

0:56:24	SPEAKER_06
 It depends on the order that you're doing.

0:56:26	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so if every root that's, since it's a real signal, the LPC polynomial is going to have real coefficients.

0:56:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that means that every root that is not a real root is going to be a complex pair, a complex value and it's conjugate.

0:56:49	SPEAKER_00
 So for each, and if you look at that on the unit circle, one of these, one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_00
 One will be a negative frequency, I think.

0:56:58	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm using an a-thorded polynomial and I'll get three or four of these pairs.

0:57:07	SPEAKER_00
 Which gives me three or four P positions.

0:57:10	SPEAKER_06
 This is from synthetic speech?

0:57:12	SPEAKER_06
 That's right.

0:57:13	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so if it's from synthetic speech, then maybe it'll be cleaner.

0:57:16	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, for a real speech, then what you end up having is, I guess, a funny little things that don't exactly fit your notion of formats all that well.

0:57:24	SPEAKER_06
 But mostly they do.

0:57:25	None
 Yeah.

0:57:25	SPEAKER_06
 And what we were doing, which is not so much looking at things, it was okay because it was just a question of quantization.

0:57:34	SPEAKER_06
 We were just, you know, a story.

0:57:36	SPEAKER_06
 It was, we were doing a stored speech quantization.

0:57:39	SPEAKER_04
 But in your case, actually you have peaks that are not at the form of positions.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_04
 But there are lower in energy when they are much lower.

0:57:52	SPEAKER_03
 If this is synthetic speech, can't you just get the formats directly?

0:57:56	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, how was the speech created?

0:57:58	SPEAKER_00
 It was created from a synthesizer.

0:58:00	SPEAKER_00
 And was an performance synthesizer.

0:58:04	SPEAKER_06
 It may have been, but maybe he didn't have control of it or something.

0:58:06	SPEAKER_00
 In fact, we could get format frequencies out of the synthesizer as well.

0:58:12	SPEAKER_00
 And one thing that the LPC approach will hopefully give me in addition is that I might be able to find the...

0:58:21	SPEAKER_00
 the bandwidth of these HOMPS as well.

0:58:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm still fine suggested looking at each complex pair as a second order.

0:58:29	SPEAKER_00
 I are filter.

0:58:31	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't think there's a really good reason not to get the format frequencies from the synthesizer instead.

0:58:37	SPEAKER_00
 Except that you don't have the psychoacoustic modeling in that.

0:58:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:58:42	SPEAKER_06
 So the actual...

0:58:43	SPEAKER_06
 So you're not getting the actual formats per se.

0:58:46	SPEAKER_06
 You're getting something that is a festrongly affected by the PLP model.

0:58:54	SPEAKER_06
 And so it's more psychoacoustic.

0:58:56	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, I see.

0:58:57	SPEAKER_06
 It's sort of a different thing.

0:58:58	SPEAKER_06
 That's sort of the point.

0:58:59	SPEAKER_06
 But yeah, ordinarily, in a form of synthesizer, the bandwidths as well as the form and centers are...

0:59:06	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, that's somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in.

0:59:10	SPEAKER_06
 But yeah, you view each complex pair as essentially a second order section.

0:59:14	SPEAKER_06
 Which has a band center bandwidth.

0:59:17	SPEAKER_06
 And...

0:59:23	None
 Okay.

0:59:24	SPEAKER_06
 So, you're going back today and then back in a week, I guess.

0:59:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:59:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:59:30	None
 Great.

0:59:30	SPEAKER_06
 Welcome.

0:59:31	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we should do digits quickly.

0:59:33	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, digits.

0:59:34	SPEAKER_06
 I don't forget.

0:59:35	SPEAKER_06
 I don't forget our daily digits.

0:59:37	SPEAKER_06
 I'm not bad.

0:59:38	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.
