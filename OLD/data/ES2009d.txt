0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I told me.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't know where to go.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 I was like, cool.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 All right, it is PowerPoint time.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I've done more power points in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just kind of fun.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 So here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and right.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 So I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, really?

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I think.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm there for I'm taking minutes.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 So just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from the last meeting.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 I will open them slowly.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 Wait for it.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_02
 Wait for it.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's not you.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 Wait.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_01
 This is very high powered stuff here.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 So basically the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer from Nathan and Ron and Sarah about what we can do here and what sort of limitations we're operating with.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Excuse me, limitations were operating under what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with their voice recognition that had a vaguely non remote like shape because you didn't really use it as a remote as you could just use your voice.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 It would include some mostly just a simple design features for a television operation, but with a slider full now bay for more advanced functions for users.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 And the the idea and the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press to look at.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that sort of that the main.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm going to go ahead and take it away guys.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we have a simple our prototype.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_03
 What's to be said about it.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 We took into account a lot of things that we went over in the last meeting.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 And then we decided not to go for the touch screen, which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 This is going to be the on and off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then to volume buttons down here.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_03
 And then for the more advanced functions, there's a slide out panel here.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 You can see that there's a lot of things going on, but this actually can slide back in.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 It's very nice aesthetic when it's all put away.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_03
 As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with multiple colors.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_04
 Now, it's important to we talked quite a bit about the interchangeable faces.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 And what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_04
 We call it fruity.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, that's interchangeable.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would be desirable for the regular product in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued, but this is kind of something that can be done.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_04
 And as you can see on the television there, we have the voice detector device on the top.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 So that will work quite well with regard to finding this contraption.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_04
 What other things do we see here?

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if you give it a touch, it does have actually a bit of a spongey feel.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that will work well in regards to our market.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_04
 Clearly, there's going to be some more colors and what not available.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have anything else to add to that?

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'm worried about the materials.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 The entire thing is covered in rubber coating.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very durable.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to break like some types of plastic that's dropped.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, as you can see, if you touch it, it does have that nice squishy feel.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's actually important to note that the television, if there's an earthquake or anything like that, it actually is edible inside.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you noticed, but I wrote the company's name.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 This is actually an apple on the inside.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need to worry about rot factors?

0:06:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's encased in a new type of product.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 We got a bit ahead of ourselves.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 I know we're not talking about making televisions.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's a way for the future.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's a couple of years off at least.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that sums up the main features of the remote.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if you guys have any questions or whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 Did we come in under budget?

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 We did.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 We did that.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 We did that.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 We didn't have to use as many microchips, which was quite nice.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's how to keep the cost down.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 We had a lot of people who were talking about the modern technology.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the voice recognition.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 In a lot of ways, it's just a simple remote.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers, we might be able to get it even cheaper.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 On the back here, you'll notice this area here, which is actually the voice recognition console.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's nicely designed into the overall look.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has come up with.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think that has given a proven ease of use and whatnot.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 It allows futures like the remote actually talking back to the user.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:08:53	None
 Any questions?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have other, for lack of a word, skins covers a plane hour?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Are those going to be developed later?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Once we see how the couple we have go, do we stay on that yet?

0:09:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we didn't quite have enough material.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I was expecting a prototype.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 I just don't know if you guys had me in mind.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see, this is just a most superficial layer.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Something else.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a new plate on top of that.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 We definitely priced out even spongier non-natural look materials, which I think worked out fine.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 We also continued on with the ideas of following apples, color schemes with kind of the light orange and the fine.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's not quite a faceplate.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's more like a pseudo faceplate because it's simple enough that in the factory, we could very easily put a different one on it.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 It walks into place such that it's pretty permanent.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 At the same time, if we want to go the other way, it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 We could go the faceplate way, if you know what I mean.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yep, it's still an option.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 If we need it.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 Very cool.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 Nice job.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right, thanks guys.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Very, very good work.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 I like it. Brilliant.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 What we need to discuss now is the finance of it.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 You've provided a number that actually sounds quite nice.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 The trouble is I was just given this by finance.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's a spreadsheet of the parts and I just tend to put in what it's going to look like.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to clear this out real quickly.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 But it looks like...

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 If we can just itemize what's in here, it's a solar cell thing, right?

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 With a backup battery?

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's in there.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 With the back.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 The voice recognition area actually doubles as the solar cell area.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 Clever.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well then.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a speaker in a sensor at the same time, isn't it?

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's just making use of the same space and the same material.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 In the case, it's more of a single curved case.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that would be the general...

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one big curve.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 I guess you could say.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 We've got a rubber skin material basically throughout.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 Push button interface with this other dropdown.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we've got two push button interfaces.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we've got sort of a wood material, a rubbery type material.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 Special.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 Throughout.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 I guess you'd have to mark special color in special form as well.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 It is very unconventional.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I like it.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 So it looks like a bit over budget.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 Just watch out this.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 So what we could do perhaps a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the backup battery.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think that if we were talking about it being one of her main selling features being environmental and without the batteries and whatnot.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 Although it does still have a battery, so I'm not sure that what the cell is on that.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we could take the battery out of it.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 You see, and it probably worked 99% of the time, but you're going to have to set up a call center for that 1% of the time when people are calling and saying, oh, look, my remote isn't working.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_03
 What am I going to do?

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 People will be upset.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think in the long run, it's better to keep the battery.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's hard to scrap the whole solar battery idea because that's so integral to the theme that we have.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's difficult. We have all these things integral to the design of it that we just can't back out of now. It has to be.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 Seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 If we were going to try to undo one bit, we'd probably have to undo most.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 Although we don't want to get rid of the whole environmental.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, obviously, the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this is like a natural new thing.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 But honestly, if we cut that one piece out, we're actually coming in on the budget effect on my math correctly.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 You might be able to sway me on the idea that our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that's what sets us apart, right?

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what's setting us into this young market.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 And that's where we started from. So.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know. And I mean, you know, perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price, we can bring that back into the game, but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 And the reality is, you know, for me from an ideological standpoint, I'd like to stick with the solar cell, but.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of have to throw myself in the business structure and model here.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think either or I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think I'm fortunately that's our best option. See, like, where we're going to get below.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, cool.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_01
 Cause we can't remove the push buttons because they're.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can't get rid of the, I mean, removing the change in the case wouldn't be so much of a.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Nor would change in the case materials.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, that looks like to be the only thing.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so that would be a major change, but.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 All right, so we're in agreement on that.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Unfortunately, I think we are.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was a good compromise.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Moving along swiftly. So I guess now we just go to the project evaluation.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Which I will allow.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 That will be me.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, sorry.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 No problem.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 You reach.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 It will be great.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't even do that on purpose.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I was just evaluating.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 From what we know of how our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 Like we feel they're important.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 So I was looking at basic design things.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 Does it fulfill its function as a remote?

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design what we wanted to do?

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Our technology is up to where we'd hope they would be.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 And does it fulfill the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for?

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on?

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Does it respond to voice recognition?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 And overall in general, it looks like it's coming up to par.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 The only thing is with the pullout panel, that is going to take some adjusting because of the new interface.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 That looked like it was coming up rough.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 But then once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 So I think overall we're heading in the right direction.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 Like that sponge of you.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 It looks like it's going over well.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 The future function works well.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's good to hear.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_02
 We're good.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think eventually if we do branch out with this program, maybe when we do have higher budget options, and if it goes over with this model, we can look into wider range voice recognition, like from other rooms of the house and stuff.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 But for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 So it's all good.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 Really?

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's it for me.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 Losing the solar panel.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 It is a setback, but.

0:17:53	None
 Okay.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 Do you need the cord back?

0:17:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we might have lost that granola market again.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, they don't want to tell you anything.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:18:06	None
 Right.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 So this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 I got this slide from the coach, and I'm not sure what it's connected to.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess we are going to discuss.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Project process.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that is going to go into my report.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess this is the point where we go.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 Out of role.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 How that all worked, I guess.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 As in within the team.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, right.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 It is now.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 But I trust that she would jump in if I was.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 So any thoughts?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 We can start in these points here.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_01
 When did you guys feel about the process?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 You know, I think in general, for a day's worth of work, we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 And the technology has definitely been a help.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't use the whiteboard at all.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, no whiteboard.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 We could now.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 And I feel like if you guys have been designing in here, perhaps that would have changed, but because of room constraints, it doesn't really matter.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 Also, had I not been intrigued about the pen, I don't think I would have used it at all.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't write barely anything.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think I was taking notes more often than usual.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 It was pretty cool.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 I am disappointed.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't get a note back for my personal coach.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Is he right?

0:20:24	SPEAKER_03
 Personal coach.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 But I didn't get her.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 See.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 What if you get a response two or three months from now?

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what kind of coaching is that really?

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 What if I really needed something?

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 I think there was a lot of room for creativity.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 We could do everything.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, we wanted until the budget came down on us.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 And even then, we did get a decent product turned out, although it's not everything we wanted it to be.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with the natural look.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's very natural.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 Organic, really.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 They had a peeler in here.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 And highly resourceful teammates might add, which is always a class.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was really creative, actually.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'm impressed.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
 The teamwork was good.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 The proof that we weren't wasteful.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 We didn't waste a single bit of play to waste every bit.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 Nice.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 All four of those little containers.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 Including the multicolored wave pattern.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 By one criticism is that we didn't have enough colors to work with.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 We only had four.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 You could have developed multiple skins, really.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 More colors.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 It would be amazing.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, well.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 What did you guys think about the roles?

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 They were good?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of fun?

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 It was, I think it was pretty clever because we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled the gaps enough.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 At the same time, you had enough room to kind of just make things up.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 Do you?

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Do I just feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's just me, but I didn't actually get any information.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 That's the presentation at all.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 I got the spreadsheet.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't even get an email.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like, that was it.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 But then, you know, fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity up.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to what to do.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no, but also, yeah, when I was reporting about what each of us was doing, I was often talking to people just as to what you were doing.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 That was a good bunch.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 And then I also felt like a lot of our discussion would center around specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface version, which is what the whole project was about.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 You're very much so.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_04
 But, and then in the end, I think our job's kind of melded together a little more.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 That was fun.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's fun.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 The most helpful thing out of everything was getting the PowerPoint slides already put together.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, we didn't have that.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 There's no way we could have got all that done in time.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Very much so.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
 And I think your leadership was quite good.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 It was.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 She said, she actually made a comment off on the boy.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 You're getting into this.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 And I really, it's true.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 I did get it.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 I felt like I got way too into it.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of a good thing.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like I'm a lot.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 You're the rest of us in the structure to work with.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 So, hey.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, is that the first time you're taking on that kind of rule?

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 The first time you've ever done anything like project management.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 I usually organize crap.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's one thing to do, you know, set up a party with your friends.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 A little different.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 But you guys felt that you could keep the suspension of disbelief kind of like the role.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all like 14th.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 Look at that.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 I had to admit, as soon as we started, I mean, as soon as we got the play-doh.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 I can only imagine.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 You know, the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like us, you know.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Also like us too, like in a game of control or spaceship.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 We should have spaceship like us.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 Do you guys ever used to build a spaceship like us?

0:24:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Still everybody knows.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 Totally.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Best spaceships ever.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 You guys felt like there was enough teamwork and all.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:34	None
 Thanks.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't know.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 I was just.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_02
 No, I didn't actually.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, other than minor discussion at meetings, there wasn't.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 Except for the actual building.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 But I feel like if this was a team project, there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming used the board.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and this would have been six months worth of work, not like three hours worth of meetings.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think had the issue, being more serious, we probably would have brainstormed more during our meetings as a chair.

0:25:07	None
 Yeah.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, I'm unconscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's kind of like, like, yeah, that is kind of.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of fascinating, wasn't it?

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the whole process is.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 I wonder why, is there anything about the way that we got so much from it?

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 What was the kept us from going to the board?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if there was a right.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 Mine was the mics.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's it.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 I was afraid of the break.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 The mics are loose and each time you get up, it's a possibility of tripping over something.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_03
 You can tangle there.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't know what I would have shown on that board.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 But it didn't even occur to me as an option.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I don't know that I would have, but I know that I consciously didn't.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's just like the paper.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what I really need the paper for.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 True.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 Because I've got this laptop.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 And I just use it because it was literally right in front of me.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 I want to see the output files from the digital paper.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 My handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, see what it looks like in PDF format or something.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 Usually I would do a lot more to doing too.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 I felt like I needed to be professional.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 So I didn't like draw a paper and stuff.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not entirely, but still.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 I do have less than I usually do.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm curious about what the debriefing is going to be like.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 You know, like what is the, well, exactly we're looking for here.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 So this is all I need to go through.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if the new idea is found.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 It is about ideas.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 Did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that?

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's the thing.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 I got in the email.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 I got this PowerPoint file, but this slide was.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 That slide was like that.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't change this one at all.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess one, the right track.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_04
 Any new ideas with regard to.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 We're by no control concept.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 No, I kind of like.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think they still do their job.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you're fine.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 I am thinking outside the little square box though.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 Literally in like form.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe a circle would be all right.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, different.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of make you wonder.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how much can you do with the remote control?

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's like inventing a new car.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, you got to be technically car shanker won't fit on the road.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be back into.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, how long was I mean, it's supposed to be?

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 40 ish.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 I wish you go on a bit.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, about the project you've out.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, but you guys, but I felt like.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 A bit.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 Understimulated on the whole thing.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 Like what like, you know, what am I really doing?

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 You know, what is.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 At the beginning, it started out and I felt actually like under pressure, like the first couple.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_02
 And I was like, had like all this brainstorming I was doing.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 And then suddenly I was like, well, it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, so.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was the real.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 You know what I mean?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 Like we also knew when we were headed with it.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 So it didn't feel.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 When I first filled up the question, I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to, how much I stressed over it.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 And then by the time I got to the last, I was like, yeah, whatever.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was also a realization of basically just copy and paste.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_04
 Let's give it to you.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 Which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 I actually didn't do that at all though.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 Every single one, all the presentations, I either added slides or edit them.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I added like five slides.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 See, I only got blank ones.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 I just got blank ones.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Really?

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 My slides were all blank.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 They'd have a title maybe.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 And they were just empty.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 Like mine, yeah, they didn't come like this.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like this was what it looks like.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like with those words are on it.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 Literally just like that.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 What do I hear is always so more complicated.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 I just needed slides.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think I added a slide one time.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_04
 I had many slides every time.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 With the whole new background.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 That was pretty cool.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 That was class.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 High moment.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, really?

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Any of the thoughts come to mind?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 I want to know how our product was there.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 I can't.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would fail.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be expensive.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Especially like that.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 And Apple would have read about that.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 He would have been high.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 It was skeptical.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 But you know the whole thing.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 Even you.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 you. We kind of designed it to look a little bit like face.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 Here by happy face.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, that looked a lot more like a tongue previous to build other design modifications.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some taint file from a random

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 pick at bar that had re-consumed by accident.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 An interesting day, I don't know.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'd say so. So again, I reiterate my question of how different we are compared to the other groups, especially between culture groups.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 I know.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically, you know, from the basics to the concept.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 Although the whole concepts thing, the whole concepts phase, I don't think I really understood like the concept.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the idea.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 OK, connocean of functional item.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, it's like I have a concept of a mug's material.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's just it is what it is.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 You know, maybe rather than concepts, you should be thought of.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 We should.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 I thought of it.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 I thought of rather than terms of concept, I thought of it in terms of.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 Like.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's a proposed idea and then the final would be like the actual specified prototype or whatever.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 Bono is kind of interesting.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we have more slides.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 No, just this closing one.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if established at the cost weren't really within budget, but we could.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 We got it to be.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 We did the project evaluation based on.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 But Sarah's evaluation of on offs with.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 It was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 In general, which is not sure is the same thing at the time that just made more sense, but I could see if they were really asking about.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 Us.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 Of course we did.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 We had a fight think about it.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 And it's all recorded.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 And what I'm going to I'm going to put.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff like because and so forth.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I'll put most of it in the cards.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 I've had to done.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 The whole branch of psychology that looks into that cycle in the six.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 What the guys are sitting here.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, he's studying.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 Something.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yep, they're called the disfluidities.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 Disfluidities.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good word for it.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we like our fancy phrases and.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 Just add some prefixes sounds class here.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 I will save this into the.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 I find myself hitting the send and receive button.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 I can pull something.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I know something.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 Come on, give me some information.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be fair, we're hooked.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 We're all hooked on the internet.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, we are addicts.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's scary.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it is scary.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just throw on that either.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 I know imagine we went the first 10, 15 years of our lives without the internet.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's only the last 10 that were like what was the internet.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you know, just in the past five, we've gone from 28 eight modems to broadband all the time.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've had internet for like 18 years.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, we have, but not in the sense.

 It's so, you know, my grandparents had an 80s and I got it in 94, but still it's crazy.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_02
 So in the 80s, my grandma does computer science back in the States.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 And so they had an EDU and Gov Network.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 There's basically the fundamental structures, but it wasn't household household yet because it hadn't been.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it was to the like seven universities or something.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 That was him.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_04
 You guys ready to celebrate?

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's how I said that includes like

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 champagne or something exciting.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Should probably call that meeting to an end. I think that's a closer.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's been 40 minutes or whatever.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's been long enough.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 So great.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 Where'd you find that?

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 I have no idea.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's at the only song I have.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_03
 There's another one.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 This is where I was media player.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's awesome.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 The default track.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was David Burns looking to the eyeball.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's when it seems to be shipping with her, or the ship with for a while.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe this is a new version.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 So is that a close?

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I guess we'll call that a day.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 The end of the meeting.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 Fab.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you, gentlemen.
