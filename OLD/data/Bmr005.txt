0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 So, okay, it doesn't look like a crash, that's great.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_08
 So I think maybe what's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it's working.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_08
 And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_08
 I won't do that anymore.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_02
 And it looks like you've found a way of mapping the location to that without having people have to give their names each time.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's like you have the...

0:00:25	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_02
 So you know that...

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, are you going to write down that I said here?

0:00:28	SPEAKER_08
 I'm going to collect the digit forms and write it down.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_08
 So they should be right with what's on the digit forms.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_08
 Okay, so I'll go ahead and start with the digits.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_06
 Commнибудь

0:06:02	SPEAKER_08
 We should add a feel to the form here for native language.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_06
 You know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea. I think I've probably forgot that.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_08
 But I think that would be a good thing.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_08
 After I just printed out a Zillion of them.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_06
 So I do have a agenda suggestion.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_06
 I think the things that we talk about in this meeting tend to be a mixture of procedural mundane things and research points.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_06
 And I was thinking, I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff because that's easier to get out of the way.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_06
 And then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_06
 Andreas had to leave.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_06
 So I suggest we turn around.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_06
 And sort of we have, anyway, has some mundane points that we could send in an email later, hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the research, kind of, things.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_06
 So the one thing I know that we have on that is we had talked a couple of weeks before about the stuff you were doing with attempting to locate events.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_06
 We had little go around trying to figure out what you meant by events.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_06
 But I think what we had meant by events, I guess, was points of overlap between speakers.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_06
 But I gathered from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean interruptions with something else like some other noise.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_06
 Yes?

0:07:37	SPEAKER_06
 You mean that is an event also?

0:07:39	SPEAKER_06
 Senator, you have done some work on that.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_06
 And then the other thing might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other research areas that we're thinking about doing.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_06
 I think, especially since you haven't been, and this means a little bit, maybe, in some discussion of some of the plausible things to look at how we're starting to get data.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_06
 And one of the things I know that also came up is some discussions that Jane had with Lucandra about some work about.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_06
 I don't want to try to say it, because I'll say it wrong.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_06
 But anyway, some potential collaboration there about the working with these data.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, sure.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_06
 So don't around.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know if this is sort of like everybody has something contribute sort of thing.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_06
 I think there's just a couple of people primarily.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_06
 But why not?

0:08:45	SPEAKER_06
 Actually, I think that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_06
 So when you start with that.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 Child.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just explain a little more.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 So he was interested in the question, relating to the research that he presented recently, of inference structures, and the need to build in this sort of mechanism for understanding language.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_02
 And he gave the example in his talk about how, I'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now, but it's something about how Joe Slip, John had washed the floor or something like that.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, OK, this time sequence, but also the causal aspects of the floor and how it might have been the cause of the fall, and that it was the other person who fell, and the one who cleaned it, and these sorts of things.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 So I looked through the transcript that we had so far, and found identified a couple different types of things of that type.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 And one of them was something like, during the course of the transcript, we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 And the question was raised, well, should we restart the recording at this point?

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 And Daniela said, well, we're just so far ahead of the game right now, we really don't need to.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference?

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 So the inferences that are involved are things like, so how do you interpret ahead of the game?

0:10:25	SPEAKER_02
 So it's metaphorically.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_02
 What you draw, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording, that we have enough space, and he continued.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's like we were so ahead of the game, because now we have built-in down sampling.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_02
 So you have to get the idea that ahead of the game is speaking with respect to space limitations that in fact down sampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 But there are a lot of different things like that.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_08
 So do you think his interest is in using this as a data source or training material or what?

0:11:11	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I should have maybe interject, because this started off with a discussion that I had with him.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_06
 So we were trying to think of ways that his interest could interact with our resume.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_06
 And I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data and such things might be useful for that, in order before we invested too much effort into that, you should have looked into some of the data that we already have, and see, is there anything to this at all?

0:11:43	SPEAKER_06
 Is there any point to which you think that you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it?

0:11:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because it could be that you looked through it and you'd say, well, this is just the wrong task for him to pursue his.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_06
 And I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this, just a little sample that you looked at that it's possible at least.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we met and he was going to go and look through them more systematically, and then meet again.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not a matter.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_06
 Anyway, that's quite different than anything we've talked about that might come out from this.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_09
 So he gave me his text.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, that's his major.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_09
 That's his major.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 Just using text.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 I mentioned several that had to do with implications drawn from international contours.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 And that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 He's interested in these knowledge structures, inferences that you draw from.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, he certainly could use text.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_06
 We were, in fact, looking to see if there is there something in common between our interested meetings and his interest in this stuff.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_06
 So.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_08
 And I imagine that transcripts of speech, text that his speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_08
 I don't know whether or not that it means.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_06
 Probably depends on what the prepared writing was.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 Because in narratives, you know, I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it could be really tedious.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, when you're face to face, you have a lot of back channel.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_08
 And oh, that aspect.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_08
 And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference-drumping if it's face to face.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, so if I just read that Dan was saying we're ahead of the game in that context, I might not realize that he was talking about discuses and opposed anything else.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 I had several that had to do with back channels.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 And this wasn't one of them.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 This one really does make you leap from, so he said, we're ahead of the game, we have built in down sampling.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 And the inference, if you had it written down, would be, but there are others that have back channels.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_02
 It was less interested in those.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry to interrupt.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 A minute, seven minutes ago, I briefly was not listening.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 And so who is he in those context?

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there's a lot of people.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so I was just realizing, you guys have been talking about E for at least three, three, four minutes without ever mentioning the person's name again.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 So this is going to be a big, big problem if you want to later do indexing or speech understanding of any sort.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 I wrote this down.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 You guys know this?

0:14:28	SPEAKER_09
 As Morgan will say, well, you had some ideas.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_09
 And he never said, he looked.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I think he's doing that intentional.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_08
 Right, yes, great.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_09
 So this is really great because the thing is, because he's looking at the first, even for addresses in the conversation, I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, that would be interesting.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know, when, yeah, if you have the PZM, you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_08
 Well, especially with Morgan, with the way we have the microphones arranged, I'm sort of right on axis.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_08
 And it would be very hard to tell.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 But you have things like this.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 You'd have Fainter.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 Wouldn't you get Fainter reception out here?

0:15:10	SPEAKER_08
 Sure, but I think if I'm talking like this, right now I'm looking at Jane and talking now.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_08
 I'm looking at Chuck and talking.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_08
 I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_08
 But you don't have this problem.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_06
 Morgan is someone who does.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_08
 So if I'm talking to you, or I'm talking to you.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_06
 I've probably been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about concerns about, oh, I'm going to say something bad and so on.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_06
 And so I'm tending to stay away from people's names, even though.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_09
 Even though you could pick up later on just from the acoustic.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_09
 Who you really did mention who he was.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 But I missed it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Can I say it?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, no, no, no, it isn't sensitive at all.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_06
 I was overreacting just because we've been talking about it.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 And in fact, it is sensitive.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 I came up with something from the Kimmer's Abjects People that I wanted to mention.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it fits into the area of Monday.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 And but they did say, I asked her very specifically about this cause of how it says, no individuals will be identified in any publication using the data.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 OK, well, individuals being identified.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say you have a snippet that says, Joe thinks such and such about this field, but I think he's wrong-headed.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I mean, we're going to be careful not to have the wrong-headed part in there.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 But let's say we say Joe used to think so and so about this area.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 And in his publication, he says that, but I think he's changed his mind or whatever.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Then the issue of being able to trace Joe because we know he's well known in this field and all this and tie it to the speaker, whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names anymore of them.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 We have to because if there's a slander's aspect to it, then how much do we want to be able to have to remove?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well, there's that.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_06
 But I mean, I think also to some extent it's just educating the human subjects people in a way.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_06
 Because if there's court transcripts, there's transcripts of radio shows.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, people say people's names all the time.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_06
 So I think it can't be bad to say people's names.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_06
 It's just that, I mean, you're right that there's more potential.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_06
 If we never say anybody's name, then there's no chance of slandering anybody.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_06
 But then it won't.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_06
 It's not me.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_09
 If we, yeah, I mean, we should do whatever is natural in a meeting if we weren't being recorded.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_06
 So my behavior is probably not natural and so.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to ask, my feeling on it wasn't really important who said it.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, since you have to go over the transcripts later anyway, you could make it one of the jobs of the people who

0:17:41	SPEAKER_08
 do that to mark about this during an anonymization. If we wanted to go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_08
 And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we really can't.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_06
 But actually, I'm sorry, I really would like to push.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 How did you say?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 No, I just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy for potentially.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 So we need to talk about this later.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I didn't tend to this policy.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_06
 It was just unconscious.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_06
 Well, semi-conscious behavior.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_06
 I sort of knew who he is.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_09
 I remember who he is.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_09
 No, I didn't say you still know who he is.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_06
 With that presence.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_06
 We were talking about Dana one point.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_06
 We were talking about Lucindra, another point.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_06
 And I remember which part.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the difference was Lucindra.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 OK, that makes sense.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_09
 Down trembling.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_05
 Good.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can do all these inferences.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_06
 I would like to move it into what Jose has been doing.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_06
 He's actually doing something.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 He's supposed to the rest of us.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 I remember that my first objective in the projects is to study different parameters.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 To find a good solution.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 To detect the overlapping zone in speech record.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_04
 But in that way, I am speaking to study and to analyze the different sessions.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_04
 To find, to locate, to mark, to different overlapping zones.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 So I was, I had transcluing the first session.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 And I had found 1,000 acoustic events.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_04
 Besides the overlapping zone, I mean the spreads, expression, tag, club.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what is the difference.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_04
 You used to name the.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_08
 Landspeach zone.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_08
 Which.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_08
 I don't think we've been doing it at that level of detail.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_08
 So.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't need to level the different acoustic.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_04
 I prefer because I would like to study.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_04
 I will find a good parameter to detect the overlapping.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to test this parameter with another acoustic events.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
 To find what is the false.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_04
 The false hypothesis which I produced that when we use this parameter, a big difference.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_07
 You know, so I think some of these that are the non-speech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell what there's to there.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_07
 If it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily or something like that.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_07
 It might be hard to know that it was two separate events.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_08
 You weren't talking about just overlaps, or you were just talking about acoustic events.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_04
 Someone started, someone stopped.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 I talked about acoustic events in general.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 But my objective will be to study overlapping zones.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_06
 How many overlaps were there?

0:21:17	SPEAKER_04
 In 12-15 minutes, I found 1,000 acoustic events.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 How many of them were the overlaps of speech, though?

0:21:25	SPEAKER_04
 How many are most 300 in one session?

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 In fight in 45 minutes?

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 300 overlapping.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 300 overlapping.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 Overlapped speech with different duration.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, three people to people.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to consider one people with different noise in the background.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_06
 No, no.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_06
 I think what she's asking is, if at some particular stretch, you had three people talking instead of two, did you call that one event?

0:22:11	SPEAKER_04
 I consider one event for all the songs.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I consider an acoustic event.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 The overlapping songs, the period where three speakers are talking together.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_08
 So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking also overall of us.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_08
 How many events would that be?

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 Should they be?

0:22:36	SPEAKER_08
 So two people are talking.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_08
 And then a third person starts talking.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_08
 Is there an event right here?

0:22:42	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 For me, is there overlapping songs?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 So if two or more people are talking?

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 You have more voice, if they're using them in moments.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so I think we just wanted to understand how you're defining it.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_06
 So then in the region, since there is some continuous region, in between regions where there is only one person speaking, and one continuous region like that, you're calling an event.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_06
 Is it, are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event, or are you calling the entire length of it the event?

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 I consider the entire, all the time where the voices are overlapping.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't distinguish between the numbers of speakers.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not considering the fact of, for example, what you say, first two jokers are speaking, and third person joined to that.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 For me, it's all that song with several numbers of speaker is the same acoustic event.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 But without any mark between the song or the overlapping song, with two speaker speaking together, the song with the three speakers.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_02
 That would just be one.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 With the beginning mark and the ending mark.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_04
 Because for me, it's a song with some kind of distortion in the special.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Well, by the moment, by the moment.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_08
 But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, good.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 I have to start somewhere.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we have to start somewhere.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_04
 We're just right away.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what we're talking about.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_06
 So again, that's three hundred in 45 minutes that are speaker, just speakers.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_06
 OK, yeah.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_06
 So that's about eight per minute.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 For 1,000 events in 12 minutes, that's that can actually be tapped.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Well, 1,000 taps in eight minutes is a lot of fun.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_04
 I consider acoustic events the silent two.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_04
 Silence, starting or silent two things.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 To detect because I consider acoustic events, all the things are not speech.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_04
 You're in the general point of view.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 OK, so how many of the speech?

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 That speech or too much speech.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_06
 So how many of the 1,000 were silent?

0:25:19	SPEAKER_06
 Silence, actually.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 This is silent.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 I haven't.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to do a statistic study with you with a report from the study from the session, one session.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 And I found another thing.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_04
 When I was a look at the difference speech file, for example, we use the Mrs. file to transcribe the events and the words.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 I saw that the speech signal collected by this kind of mic or this kind of mic are different from the Mrs.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_04
 signer we collect by a microphone.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's right.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 But the problem is the following.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 I knew that the signal will be different.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 But the problem is we detected difference events in the speech file collected by a mic compared it with the Mrs. file.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_04
 And so if you try to crack only using the Mrs. file, it's possible if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system, it's possible.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 And you use the speech file collected by the Fed mic to do experiments with the system if possible to evaluate or to consider acoustic events that which you marked in the Mrs. file at the donor pure in the speech signer collected by.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_08
 The reason that I generated the mix file was for IBM to do word level transcription.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_08
 It's a double the VAT transcription.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_08
 So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription that the mix signals here, I mean, if I'm tapping on the table, it's not going to show up on any of the mics.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_08
 But it's going to show up rather loudly on the PZM.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_04
 So I say that this only because I, in my opinion, it's necessary to put the transcription on the speech file collected by the objective signer.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean the signer collected by the real mic in the future, the prototype, to correct the initial segmentation with the real speech you have to analyze, you have to process.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 Because I found it a difference.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well, just in that one 10 second or whatever was example that Adam had that we passed on to others a few months ago, there was that business where, I guess, was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_06
 And in the close talking mics, you couldn't hear the overlap.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_06
 And then the distant mic, you're good.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_06
 So yeah, it's clear that if you want to study, if you want to find all the places where they're overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mic.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_06
 On the other hand, there's other phenomena that are going out at the same time before which it might be useful to look at the close talking mic.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_09
 So it's...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_09
 But why can't you use the combination of the close talking mic?

0:28:59	SPEAKER_08
 If you use the combination of the close talking mics, you would hear Jane interrupting me, but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_08
 And so if your interest is...

0:29:06	SPEAKER_06
 So have it's masking, Matt.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_09
 If you're interested in speakers, you're working on those things.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_09
 And not the other kind of non speech.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_08
 Right.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_08
 Right.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_08
 So all of the other issue is that the mixed close talking mics, I'm doing weird normalizations and things like that.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_09
 But it's known.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_09
 Yep.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, the normalization you do is over the whole conversation.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_09
 Over the whole meeting.

0:29:28	None
 Yep.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_09
 So if you wanted to study people overlacking people, that's not a problem.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_04
 I saw the...

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 But I have a...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 In your response, I saw this pitchfai...

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 I was really collected by the fed mic.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the signal to noise, a relation is low.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's very low.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's very...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 We compare it with the headphone.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I found that...

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 Probably, in not sure by the moment.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 But this is probably that a lot of...

0:30:11	SPEAKER_04
 For example, in the overlapping song, and in several parts of the files where you can find a smooth speech from one talking in the meeting, is probably that those files, you cannot find.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 You cannot project because it confuses with noise.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 And there are a lot of...

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 I see.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 I have to study with more detail.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 But my idea is to process only this...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_04
 This is the most of the speech.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 The fact that it is more realistic, it's more realistic, but it'll be a lot harder.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it'll be hard, but on the other hand, as you point out, if your concern is to get the...

0:31:00	SPEAKER_06
 Overliving people, people's speech, you will get that.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_06
 It's more better.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_06
 Are you making any use?

0:31:09	SPEAKER_06
 You were working with the data that had already been transcribed.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_06
 Does it?

0:31:15	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_06
 Now, did you make any use of that?

0:31:21	SPEAKER_06
 Because we have these 10 hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 The tradition by Jane, I want to use to put...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 It's a reference for me.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_04
 But the tradition, for example, I don't...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not interested in the words, the tradition, the words, for the speech file.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 But Jane, for example, puts a mark at the beginning of each talk in the meeting.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 She includes information about the song where there is a overlapping song.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 And there is any mark, time, temporal mark, to...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 To...

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 To...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_04
 To Laver.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so she is...

0:32:22	SPEAKER_04
 I think we need this information to...

0:32:28	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_06
 So the 12 hours...

0:32:32	SPEAKER_06
 Of course, this included maybe some time where you were learning about what you wanted to do.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_06
 But...

0:32:37	SPEAKER_06
 But the talk is something that 12 hours marked the 45 minutes.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_06
 12 minutes.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_06
 12 minutes.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_06
 12 minutes.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_06
 12 minutes.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 I thought you did 45 minutes.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 No, 45 minutes is the session.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_04
 All the session.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you haven't done the whole session.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 This is just 12 minutes.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 12 hours of work.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 Do... to segment a level, 12 minutes processes.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 So let me back up again.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_06
 So when you said there were 300 speaker overlaps, that's in 12 minutes.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 I consider all the session because I count the overlapping's marked by...

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 In the...

0:33:16	SPEAKER_04
 In the 45 minutes.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_06
 So it's 345 minutes, you have... you have time marked 12 minutes.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_06
 The... the...

0:33:28	SPEAKER_06
 The...

0:33:29	SPEAKER_06
 Overlaps in 12 minutes.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_06
 Got it.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Can I ask...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 Can I ask whether you found...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 You know how accurate...

0:33:37	SPEAKER_03
 James...

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 Labels were as far as...

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 You know, did you miss some overlaps or did you...

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 By the moment, I...

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't computer my...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_04
 Temporal Mark with James.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_04
 I want to do it because...

0:33:51	SPEAKER_04
 Perhaps I have errors in the marks.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_04
 If I... I compare with James, it's probably... I can correct...

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 To get more...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_04
...create the...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
...tractition.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_08
 Also, James was doing work level.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_08
 So we weren't very...

0:34:12	SPEAKER_09
 Right, right.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not expecting...

0:34:14	SPEAKER_09
 I'm not in work level, but actually...

0:34:15	SPEAKER_09
 No.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_09
 I didn't need to...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_09
...show the exact point of interruption.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_09
 You just were showing at the level of the phrase...

0:34:22	SPEAKER_09
 Or the level of the speech spurt or...

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, I would say time been.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_02
 So my goal was to get words with reference to a time been...

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 Beginning and end point.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 And sometimes, you know, I was like, You could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 But it was just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that...

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 Disrupt that unit in order to have, you know, the words in the order in which they were spoken.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 It would have been hard with the interface that we have.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Now, my app...

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'm working on course, and I realized...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's an overlapping interface, but...

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 You said we'd work, but I think we need to...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 No, of course.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 I expected to find more overlap than...

0:34:57	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
...because you're looking at it at a much more detailed level.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_04
 I want to computer it.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 I hope 60 to 1.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_06
 Well, but I have a suggestion about that.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_06
 Obviously, this is very, very time consuming...

0:35:09	SPEAKER_06
...and you're finding lots of things which I'm sure...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_06
...are going to be very interesting.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_06
 But in the interest of making progress...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_06
...my name is...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_06
...how would it affect your time if you only marked the speaker overlaps?

0:35:23	SPEAKER_06
 Only.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_06
 Yes. Do not mark any other events, but only marked speaker.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_06
 Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit?

0:35:29	SPEAKER_06
 Do you think that would speed it up?

0:35:31	SPEAKER_06
 Speed up your marking?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 I... I...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to...

0:35:38	SPEAKER_04
 I don't understand the...

0:35:39	SPEAKER_06
 It took you a long time to mark 12 minutes.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, yeah.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_06
 Now, my suggestion was for the other 33...

0:35:45	SPEAKER_04
...only to mark only 12 minutes.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and my question is, if you did that...

0:35:49	SPEAKER_06
...if you followed my suggestion...

0:35:52	SPEAKER_06
...would it take much less time?

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah. Sure.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_04
 That I think it's a good idea.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 That I think it's a good idea because...

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 I need a little time to put the label on to...

0:36:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I mean, we know that there's noise.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_06
 There's continual noise from fans and so forth.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_06
 And there is more impulsive noise from taps and so forth.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_06
 And something in between with paper rustling.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_06
 We know that all of that's there and it's a worthwhile thing to study.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_06
 But obviously, it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_06
 Whereas, I would think that we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon...

0:36:35	SPEAKER_06
...the overlapping of people talking.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so then you can get...

0:36:39	SPEAKER_06
...because you need...

0:36:40	SPEAKER_06
...if it's 300...

0:36:42	SPEAKER_06
...it sounds like you probably only have 50 or 60 or 70...

0:36:46	SPEAKER_06
...events right now that are really...

0:36:48	SPEAKER_06
...and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of...

0:36:51	SPEAKER_06
...even visual sense of what's going on...

0:36:54	SPEAKER_06
...much less than any kind of reasonable statistics.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_09
 Now, why do you need to mark...

0:36:58	SPEAKER_09
...speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy...

0:37:02	SPEAKER_08
...that's why I was going to bring up.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_09
 You shouldn't need to do this completely.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, yeah, so let's back up because you went here for an earlier conversation.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_06
 So the idea was that what he was going to be doing...

0:37:12	SPEAKER_06
...was experimenting with different measures...

0:37:15	SPEAKER_06
...such as the increase in energy...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_06
...such as the energy and the LPC residuals...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_06
...I mean, there's a bunch of things...

0:37:23	SPEAKER_06
...I mean, increased energy is sort of an obvious one.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_06
 And it's not obvious.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, you could do the dumbest thing and get it 90% of the time.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_06
 But when you start going past that and trying to do better...

0:37:38	SPEAKER_06
...it's not obvious what combination of features...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_06
...is going to give you the right detector.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_06
 So the idea is to have some ground truth first.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_06
 And so the idea of the manual marking was to say,...okay, it's really here.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_07
 But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the time...

0:37:53	SPEAKER_09
 Get it from the close talking mics.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, or get it first pass.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_09
 We talked about that.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_09
 And then go through sort of a lot better.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_06
 We talked about that.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_06
 So it's a bootstrapping thing.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_06
 The idea was we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_06
 And then whatever he could mark would be helpful.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 And it's a question of what you bootstrapped from.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_06
 You know, do you bootstrapped from a simple measurement...

0:38:19	SPEAKER_06
...which is right most of the time and then you do better...

0:38:21	SPEAKER_06
...or do you bootstrapped from some human being looking at it...

0:38:24	SPEAKER_06
...and then do your simple measurements from the close talking mic.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_06
 Even with a close talking mic, you're not going to get it right all the time.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_09
 Well, that's what I wonder because...

0:38:33	SPEAKER_08
...or how bad it is.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_08
 I'm working on a program to do that.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_09
 Because that would be interesting, especially because the bottleneck is the transcription.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_09
 Right?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_09
 We've got a lot more data than we have the solutions.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_09
 We have the auto-experts.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_09
 We have the close talking mic.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_09
 So I mean, it seems like one kind of project is not perfect.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_09
 But that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is...

0:38:56	SPEAKER_09
...if you infer from the close talking mics where the on-off points are, of speech...

0:39:01	SPEAKER_09
...we discuss that.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_09
 And how can we detect that from a far film?

0:39:05	SPEAKER_08
 I've written a program to do that.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_08
 And sorry, I'm in it.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_08
 It's okay.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_08
 But it's doing something very, very simple.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_08
 It just takes a threshold based on...

0:39:13	SPEAKER_03
 Or you can set the threshold low and then we'd out the false alarms by hand.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_08
 And then it does a median filter and then it looks for runs.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_08
 And it seems to work. I'm sort of fiddling with the parameters to get it to actually generate something.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_08
 And I haven't...

0:39:30	SPEAKER_08
 I don't...

0:39:31	SPEAKER_08
 What I'm working on, what I was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have into transcriber.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_08
 And so I told...

0:39:38	SPEAKER_08
 I said it would take about a day.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_08
 I've worked on it for about half a day.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_08
 So give me another half day and I will have something we can play with.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_06
 See, this is where we really need the meeting record to query stuff to be working.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because we had these meetings and we had this discussion about this and I'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_06
 But I could remember all of it.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_06
 So I think it was partly that...

0:39:56	SPEAKER_06
 You know, give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_06
 Partly that we have some ground truth to compare against when he gets his thing going.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_09
 It was definitely good to have somebody look at us thinking as a way to speed up.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_06
 But that was exactly the notion that we discussed.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_02
 Another thing we discussed was that...

0:40:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's the idea.

0:40:20	None
 I think that's the idea.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_02
 The idea was that there was this already a script, I believe, that Dan had written, that handles bleed through.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, because you have this close...

0:40:33	SPEAKER_02
 You have contamination from other people who speak loudly.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, and I haven't tried using that.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_08
 It would probably help the program that I'm doing to first feed it through that.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_08
 It's a cross-correlation filter.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_08
 So I haven't tried that.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_08
 So it might be something...

0:40:49	SPEAKER_08
 It might be a good way of cleaning it up a little.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_02
 Having that be a pre-processor and then run it through yours.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_02
 But that's a refinement.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_06
 I think we want to see try the simple thing first because you have this complex thing up afterwards that does something good.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_06
 You sort of want to see what the simple thing does first.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_06
 But having somebody have some experience again with marking it from a human standpoint...

0:41:11	SPEAKER_06
 I don't expect Jose to do it for 50 hours of speech.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_06
 But I mean, if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlapped so that we had, say, for 45 minutes, then at least we'd have 300 examples of it when Adam was doing his automatic thing.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_06
 He could then compare it to that and see what it was doing.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_07
 I did something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_07
 And it works pretty well.

0:41:36	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, almost exactly what you described, an energy detector with a biggie and filter, you look for runs.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_07
 And you think like the right thing to do.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I mean, you can get...

0:41:46	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, you get them pretty far with the literature, sir.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_07
 And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to...

0:41:55	SPEAKER_08
 That's good validation.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_01
 Is this proprietary?

0:41:58	SPEAKER_08
 If you have a patent.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_07
 This one I was working for the government.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_07
 Nicey.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, then everybody owns it.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_02
 Is it something that we could just co-op to?

0:42:10	SPEAKER_06
 Well, he's pretty close.

0:42:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, anyway.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_02
 I just thought if it was tried and true, then he's gone through additional models.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_08
 Although, if you have some parameters like what's a good window size for the median filter?

0:42:22	SPEAKER_07
 I have to remember.

0:42:23	SPEAKER_07
 I'll think about it.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_03
 And it might be different for government people.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_08
 I didn't know for government work, because they say different bandwidth.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_08
 I was doing pretty short, you know, 10th of a second.

0:42:36	None
 Sort of numbers.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_06
 If we want to...

0:42:50	SPEAKER_06
 So, maybe we can move on to other things in the meantime.

0:42:54	SPEAKER_02
 One question about statistics.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_02
 12 minutes.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_02
 If we took 300 and divided it by 4, which is about the length of 12 minutes, I'd expect, like, to be 75 overlaps.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_02
 Did you find more than 75 overlaps in that period?

0:43:09	SPEAKER_02
 More than?

0:43:10	SPEAKER_02
 More than how many overlaps in your 12 minutes?

0:43:13	SPEAKER_04
 Not even.

0:43:15	SPEAKER_04
 All the...

0:43:16	SPEAKER_04
 I skype only 12 minutes from the...

0:43:21	SPEAKER_04
 I don't count the...

0:43:24	SPEAKER_04
 I consider...

0:43:27	SPEAKER_04
 I consider to be...

0:43:30	SPEAKER_08
 I bet there more, because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than...

0:43:41	SPEAKER_08
...the middle ran.

0:43:43	SPEAKER_08
 Because we're dealing with the...

0:43:45	SPEAKER_08
 In the early meetings, we're recording while we're saying, who's talking on what microphones and things like that.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_08
 And that seems to be a lot of overlap.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's an empirical question.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think we could find that out.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure that the beginning had more.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_06
 So, I was going to ask, I guess, about any other things that...

0:44:03	SPEAKER_06
 That you do want to talk about, especially since...

0:44:06	SPEAKER_06
...I'm very misleading in five minutes.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_06
 But...

0:44:09	SPEAKER_09
 I just asked about the data, like, very straightforward questions, where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just because I...

0:44:18	SPEAKER_09
 I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what...

0:44:22	SPEAKER_09
...can be done for us.

0:44:23	SPEAKER_09
 Right, so there's this...

0:44:24	SPEAKER_09
 How many meetings are we recording?

0:44:26	SPEAKER_06
 There's this 45-minute piece that Jane transcribed.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_06
 That piece was then sent IBM.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_06
 So they could transcribe as we have some comparison points.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_06
 Then there's a larger piece that's been recorded and...

0:44:40	SPEAKER_06
...put on CD-ROM and sent IBM.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

0:44:45	SPEAKER_06
 And then...

0:44:46	SPEAKER_06
 We don't know.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_06
 What's that?

0:44:48	SPEAKER_06
 That was about 10 hours and it was about...

0:44:50	SPEAKER_06
 Like, 10 meetings?

0:44:51	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, something like that.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_08
 And then 10 meetings that have been sent to IBM.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, that's right.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_06
 That has...

0:45:00	SPEAKER_06
...those have not been sent.

0:45:01	SPEAKER_07
 How many total have we recorded now?

0:45:03	SPEAKER_07
 All together?

0:45:04	SPEAKER_06
 It's saying about...

0:45:05	SPEAKER_06
 About 12...

0:45:06	SPEAKER_06
 12 or 12 or 13.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_09
 So we're recording only this meeting, like, continuously, we're only...

0:45:10	SPEAKER_09
 No.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_06
 No, no.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_06
 So that's the morning one.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_06
 That's the biggest one, chunk so far.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_06
 But there's at least one meeting recorded of the...

0:45:19	SPEAKER_06
...natural language guys.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_06
 Do they mean every week?

0:45:22	SPEAKER_06
 They do.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_06
 And we talked to them about recording some more and we're going to...

0:45:28	SPEAKER_06
 We started having a morning meeting today, starting a week or two ago...

0:45:33	SPEAKER_06
...on the front-end issues.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_06
 And we're recording those.

0:45:37	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_06
 There is a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_06
 And we're going to start recording them.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_06
 They're meeting on Tuesdays.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_06
 We're going to start recording them next week.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_06
 So actually we're going to start having a pretty significant chunk.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_06
 And so, you know, Adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy...

0:45:56	SPEAKER_06
...and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff like that.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_06
 Now that the things are starting to happen.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_06
 So right now, I'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings.

0:46:06	SPEAKER_06
 But there are scattered other meetings in it and that amount is going to grow...

0:46:10	SPEAKER_06
...so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately...

0:46:14	SPEAKER_06
...if we collect 50 or 60 hours, the meeting meetings will probably be 20 to 30 percent of it.

0:46:19	SPEAKER_09
 So there's probably...

0:46:22	SPEAKER_09
...there's three to four a week.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_08
 That's what we're aiming for.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_09
 That we're aiming for.

0:46:27	SPEAKER_09
 And they're each about an hour.

0:46:29	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, although we'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and the other things I'm not paused.

0:46:35	SPEAKER_06
 I'm sort of thinking as we've been through this a few times...

0:46:37	SPEAKER_06
...that I really don't know.

0:46:39	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe you want to do it once for the novelty.

0:46:41	SPEAKER_06
 But I don't know if in general we want to have meetings...

0:46:44	SPEAKER_06
...that we record from outside this group to do the digits.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_06
 Because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff.

0:46:50	SPEAKER_06
 And we're highly motivated.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_06
 In fact, the morning group is really motivated because they're working on connected digits.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_08
 So it's something I wanted to ask.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_08
 I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits.

0:47:02	SPEAKER_08
 We don't have to hand-transcribe the digits because we're reading them and I have those.

0:47:06	SPEAKER_08
 So I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_08
 But I haven't been doing that.

0:47:14	SPEAKER_08
 If I did that, is someone going to be working on it?

0:47:18	SPEAKER_06
 Definitely something of interest.

0:47:21	SPEAKER_06
 Absolutely.

0:47:22	SPEAKER_06
 Whoever we have working on the acoustics for the meeting recording...

0:47:26	SPEAKER_06
 I'm interested in that.

0:47:27	SPEAKER_08
 I just don't have time to do it now.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sure someone thought of this, but this reading of the numbers...

0:47:34	SPEAKER_03
...would be extremely helpful to do adaptation.

0:47:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_08
 I would really like someone to do adaptation.

0:47:42	SPEAKER_08
 So if we got someone interested in that, I think it would be great for meeting recorder.

0:47:46	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, one of the things I wanted to do...

0:47:49	SPEAKER_06
 I talked to Don about one of the possible things you could do...

0:47:52	SPEAKER_06
...or us, we have someone else do it...

0:47:54	SPEAKER_06
...is to do block echo cancellation to try to give it some of the effects of the particle effects.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, we have...

0:48:04	SPEAKER_06
 The party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation...

0:48:08	SPEAKER_06
...because people move around.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_06
 And if it's not a simple echo, like, a cross-talk kind of echo...

0:48:16	SPEAKER_06
...but it's actually room acoustics.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_06
 You can't really do inversion.

0:48:21	SPEAKER_06
 And even echo cancellation is going to be something...

0:48:25	SPEAKER_06
...someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_06
 And so the tack that we've taken is more...

0:48:31	SPEAKER_06
...let's come up with feature approaches and multi-stream approaches and so forth...

0:48:34	SPEAKER_06
...that will be robust to it for the recognizer...

0:48:36	SPEAKER_06
...and not try to create a clean signal.

0:48:39	SPEAKER_06
 That's the party line.

0:48:41	SPEAKER_06
 But it occurred to me a few months ago that party lines are always sort of dangerous...

0:48:45	SPEAKER_06
...and it's good to sort of test them, actually.

0:48:48	SPEAKER_06
 And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation...

0:48:52	SPEAKER_06
...and we should know how well that can do.

0:48:54	SPEAKER_06
 So that's something I like somebody to do at some point.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_06
 Just take these digits, take the far field signal...

0:49:01	SPEAKER_06
...and apply really good echo cancellation.

0:49:05	SPEAKER_06
 There was a nice talk recently by Lucen.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_06
 The block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me.

0:49:13	SPEAKER_06
 I'm not trying to change it sample by sample, but you have some reasonable sized blocks.

0:49:18	SPEAKER_07
 What is the artifact you've tried to recognize?

0:49:23	SPEAKER_06
 So you have a direct...

0:49:27	SPEAKER_06
...what's the difference in...

0:49:30	None
...if you were trying to recognize the familiar filter...

0:49:33	SPEAKER_06
...that was signing off.

0:49:35	SPEAKER_06
 That would subtract off the parts of the signal...

0:49:41	SPEAKER_06
...that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close talk and the distant.

0:49:45	SPEAKER_06
 So I guess the most echo cancellation...

0:49:50	SPEAKER_06
...you've given that...

0:49:57	SPEAKER_06
...you're trying to...

0:50:00	SPEAKER_06
...there's a distance between the close and the distant mic...

0:50:04	SPEAKER_06
...so there's a time delay there.

0:50:06	SPEAKER_06
 And after the time delay there's these various reflections.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_06
 And if you figure out what's the...

0:50:11	SPEAKER_06
...there's a least-grays algorithm that adjusts itself...

0:50:14	SPEAKER_06
...or adjust the weight so that you try to subtract...

0:50:16	SPEAKER_06
...essentially subtract off different reflections.

0:50:21	SPEAKER_06
 So let's take the sample case where you just had...

0:50:24	SPEAKER_06
...you had some delay in a satellite connection or something...

0:50:27	SPEAKER_06
...and then there's an echo.

0:50:29	SPEAKER_06
 And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_07
 So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those...

0:50:40	SPEAKER_07
...just the raw data.

0:50:41	SPEAKER_07
 You might hear kind of an echo...

0:50:43	SPEAKER_07
...and then this noise cancellation.

0:50:45	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I'm saying that's a simplified version of what's really happening.

0:50:49	SPEAKER_06
 What's really happening is...

0:50:50	SPEAKER_06
 Well, when I'm talking to you right now...

0:50:52	SPEAKER_06
...you're getting the direct sound from my speech...

0:50:54	SPEAKER_06
...but you're also getting the indirect sound that's bounced around the room a number of times.

0:50:59	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:51:00	SPEAKER_06
 So now if you try to completely remove the effect of that...

0:51:05	SPEAKER_06
...it's sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_06
 But not to try to completely remove it that is invert the room response...

0:51:12	SPEAKER_06
...but just to try to eliminate some of the effect of some of the echoes.

0:51:17	SPEAKER_06
 A number of people have done this...

0:51:19	SPEAKER_06
...so that if you're talking to a speaker phone...

0:51:21	SPEAKER_06
...it makes it more like it would be if you were talking right up to it.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_06
 So this is sort of the straight forward approach.

0:51:28	SPEAKER_06
 You say, I want to use this item...

0:51:33	SPEAKER_06
...but I want to just track it off various kinds of echo.

0:51:35	SPEAKER_06
 So you construct a filter...

0:51:37	SPEAKER_06
...and you have this filtered version of the speech...

0:51:41	SPEAKER_06
...get subtracted off from the original speech...

0:51:46	SPEAKER_06
...and you try to minimize the energy in some sense.

0:51:50	SPEAKER_06
 And so...

0:51:52	SPEAKER_06
 It's kind of a cleanup thing.

0:51:54	SPEAKER_06
 It's a cleanup thing, right?

0:51:56	SPEAKER_06
 So echo canceling is commonly done in Tollophany...

0:52:00	SPEAKER_06
...and it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation...

0:52:04	SPEAKER_06
...if you know you're going to be talking some distance from the mic.

0:52:08	SPEAKER_07
 In fact, when I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge...

0:52:14	SPEAKER_07
...when I had the BDN over the phone...

0:52:16	SPEAKER_07
...they had some kind of a special speaker phone...

0:52:19	SPEAKER_07
...and when they would first connect me...

0:52:21	SPEAKER_07
...it would hear all this noise.

0:52:23	SPEAKER_07
 And then it would come on and it was very clear.

0:52:27	SPEAKER_06
 So it's taking samples, it's doing adaptations, adjusting weights...

0:52:30	SPEAKER_06
...and then it's getting some.

0:52:32	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:52:34	SPEAKER_06
...anyway that's kind of a reason for something like that somebody tries...

0:52:38	SPEAKER_06
...somebody like...

0:52:39	SPEAKER_06
...and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with...

0:52:42	SPEAKER_06
...I think there'd be enough data to do it with...

0:52:44	SPEAKER_06
...and for that sort of task you wouldn't care...

0:52:47	SPEAKER_06
...but it was largely a vocabulary speech or anything.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_02
 Is Brian King's worries work related to that?

0:52:54	SPEAKER_02
 There's a different type of evaluation.

0:52:56	SPEAKER_06
 Brian King's worries work is an example of what we did...

0:53:00	SPEAKER_06
...from the opposite dogma, right?

0:53:03	SPEAKER_06
 And what I was calling a party line, which is that...

0:53:06	SPEAKER_06
...doing that sort of thing is not really what we want.

0:53:08	SPEAKER_06
 We want something more flexible...

0:53:10	SPEAKER_06
...where people might change their position...

0:53:13	SPEAKER_06
...and there might be...

0:53:15	SPEAKER_06
...there's also...

0:53:16	SPEAKER_06
...oh yeah, noise.

0:53:18	SPEAKER_06
 So that echo cancellation does not really allow for noise.

0:53:22	SPEAKER_06
 If you have a clean situation but you just have some delays...

0:53:25	SPEAKER_06
...then we'll figure out the right set of weights for your taps...

0:53:29	SPEAKER_06
...for your filter in order to reduce the effect of those echoes.

0:53:32	SPEAKER_06
 But if there's noise, then the very signal that it's looking at...

0:53:37	SPEAKER_06
...is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right...

0:53:40	SPEAKER_06
...right delays are is in correct.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_06
 And so in a noisy situation, also in a situation...

0:53:50	SPEAKER_06
...that's very, very, very long reverberation times...

0:53:53	SPEAKER_06
...really long delays, it's sort of typically impractical.

0:53:57	SPEAKER_06
 So for those kind of reasons...

0:53:59	SPEAKER_06
...and also a complete inversion.

0:54:02	SPEAKER_06
 If you actually, I mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do...

0:54:04	SPEAKER_06
...the inversion of the room acoustics.

0:54:07	SPEAKER_06
 That's difficult because...

0:54:10	SPEAKER_06
...often times the...

0:54:19	SPEAKER_06
...the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted...

0:54:22	SPEAKER_06
...you get something that's unstable.

0:54:25	SPEAKER_06
 And so if you do your estimate of what the system is...

0:54:28	SPEAKER_06
...then you try to invert it, you get a filter that actually...

0:54:31	SPEAKER_06
...rangs and goes to infinity.

0:54:34	SPEAKER_06
 So there's that sort of technical reason...

0:54:37	SPEAKER_06
...and the fact that things move, there's error currents...

0:54:39	SPEAKER_06
...I mean there's all sorts of reasons why that's not really practical.

0:54:43	SPEAKER_06
 So for all those kinds of reasons...

0:54:46	SPEAKER_06
...include we didn't want to do inversion...

0:54:48	SPEAKER_06
...and we even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation...

0:54:50	SPEAKER_06
...which isn't really inversion.

0:54:53	SPEAKER_06
 And we decided to do this approach of taking...

0:54:56	SPEAKER_06
...just picking features...

0:55:00	SPEAKER_06
...which will give you something more stable...

0:55:04	SPEAKER_06
...in the presence of or absence of room reverberation...

0:55:07	SPEAKER_06
...and that's what Brian was trying to do.

0:55:10	SPEAKER_06
 So let me just say a couple things...

0:55:14	SPEAKER_06
...that I was going to bring up.

0:55:17	SPEAKER_06
 Let's see, I guess you actually already said...

0:55:20	SPEAKER_06
...this thing about the consent forms...

0:55:23	SPEAKER_06
...which was that we now don't have to.

0:55:26	SPEAKER_06
 So this was the human subject's focus, you said this?

0:55:29	SPEAKER_02
 Apparently, we're going to do a revised form, of course.

0:55:33	SPEAKER_02
 But once a person is signing it once...

0:55:36	SPEAKER_02
...then that's valid for a certain number of meetings.

0:55:40	SPEAKER_02
 She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings...

0:55:42	SPEAKER_02
...and put that on the consent form.

0:55:44	SPEAKER_02
 I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say.

0:55:46	SPEAKER_02
 So I think from a practical standpoint...

0:55:48	SPEAKER_02
...maybe we could have them do it once every 10 meetings...

0:55:50	SPEAKER_02
...or something that won't be that many people who do it that often...

0:55:52	SPEAKER_02
...but just, you know, something else...

0:55:55	SPEAKER_02
...they don't forget that they've done it, I guess.

0:55:58	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:56:01	SPEAKER_06
 Back on data thing...

0:56:03	SPEAKER_06
...so there's this sort of one hour, ten hour, a hundred hours sort of thing...

0:56:06	SPEAKER_06
...that we have...

0:56:07	SPEAKER_06
...we have an hour...

0:56:09	SPEAKER_06
...that is transcribed.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_06
 We have 12 hours that's recorded, but not transcribed.

0:56:15	SPEAKER_06
 And at the right we're going by the end of the semester...

0:56:18	SPEAKER_06
...we'll have, I don't know, 40 or 50 or something...

0:56:21	SPEAKER_06
...if this really...

0:56:24	SPEAKER_06
...but we have that one, so see what happens.

0:56:26	SPEAKER_09
 It's three to four per week.

0:56:29	SPEAKER_06
 So, eight weeks...

0:56:32	SPEAKER_06
...not a lot of hours.

0:56:34	SPEAKER_06
 Eight weeks, ten to three, so it's 24.

0:56:36	SPEAKER_06
 So that's, yeah, so like 30 hours?

0:56:39	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, is there, I know this sounds tough, but we've got the room set up.

0:56:44	SPEAKER_09
 I was starting to think of some projects where you would use...

0:56:49	SPEAKER_09
...well, similar to what we talked about with the energy detection...

0:56:53	SPEAKER_09
...on the close talking mic.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_09
 There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask...

0:56:58	SPEAKER_09
...about how interactions happen in the meeting.

0:57:00	SPEAKER_09
 They don't require any transcription.

0:57:02	SPEAKER_09
 So what are the patterns of the energy patterns over the meeting?

0:57:05	SPEAKER_09
 And I'm really interested in this.

0:57:08	SPEAKER_09
 But we don't have a lot of data.

0:57:11	SPEAKER_09
 So I was thinking, you know, we've got the room set up.

0:57:15	SPEAKER_09
 And you can always think of also for political reasons if the XC collected, you know, 200 hours...

0:57:21	SPEAKER_09
...that looks different than 40 hours, even if we don't transcribe it ourselves.

0:57:25	SPEAKER_06
 But I don't think we're going to stop at the end of the semester.

0:57:28	SPEAKER_06
 So I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months...

0:57:32	SPEAKER_06
...we are going to have more like 100 hours.

0:57:35	SPEAKER_09
 Are there any other meetings here that we can record, especially meetings...

0:57:39	SPEAKER_09
...that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of...

0:57:43	SPEAKER_09
...that are less...

0:57:45	SPEAKER_09
...that have some more emotional aspects to them or...

0:57:50	SPEAKER_09
 We had some good ones earlier.

0:57:52	SPEAKER_09
 There is laughter.

0:57:53	SPEAKER_09
 I'm talking more about strong differences of the meeting...

0:57:56	SPEAKER_09
...maybe with manager types or...

0:57:59	SPEAKER_08
 I think it's hard to record this.

0:58:01	SPEAKER_02
 To be allowed to record.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's also a lot of people cancel out afterwards.

0:58:05	SPEAKER_02
 But I wonder if they can keep AID anyway.

0:58:07	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I was going to mention that.

0:58:09	SPEAKER_08
 That's a good idea. That would be a good match.

0:58:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so I'd mention to Adam and...

0:58:14	SPEAKER_06
...that was not the thing I was going to talk about.

0:58:16	SPEAKER_06
 I'd mention to them before that...

0:58:19	SPEAKER_06
...it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data...

0:58:23	SPEAKER_06
...by talking to acquaintances and local broadcast media.

0:58:29	SPEAKER_06
 Because we had talked before about the problem...

0:58:32	SPEAKER_06
...but using found data that it's just set up...

0:58:36	SPEAKER_06
...however they haven't set up.

0:58:38	SPEAKER_06
 They don't have any say about it.

0:58:41	SPEAKER_06
 It's typically one microphone.

0:58:43	SPEAKER_06
 And so it doesn't really give us the character six we want.

0:58:48	SPEAKER_06
 And so I do think we're going to continue recording here...

0:58:51	SPEAKER_06
...and record what we can.

0:58:53	SPEAKER_06
 But it did occur to me that we could go to friends and broadcast media...

0:58:56	SPEAKER_06
...and say, hey, you have this panel show...

0:58:59	SPEAKER_06
...or this discussion show.

0:59:02	SPEAKER_06
 And can you record multi-channel?

0:59:05	SPEAKER_06
 And they may be willing to record it with...

0:59:09	SPEAKER_06
 Tell them I could.

0:59:11	SPEAKER_06
 Well, they probably already used the PAL...

0:59:13	SPEAKER_06
...but they might be able to have it...

0:59:15	SPEAKER_06
...it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mic that was somewhat distant.

0:59:18	SPEAKER_06
 It wouldn't be exactly this setup, but it'd be that sort of thing.

0:59:21	SPEAKER_06
 And what we were going to get from UW, assuming they start recording,

0:59:25	SPEAKER_09
...is also not going to be this exact setup.

0:59:27	SPEAKER_06
 No, I think that would be great. So I was thinking of looking into that.

0:59:32	SPEAKER_06
 And the answer we had that discussion, in fact, is that it's even possible...

0:59:35	SPEAKER_06
...since, of course, many radio shows are not live...

0:59:38	SPEAKER_06
...that we could invite them to record some of their shows here.

0:59:44	SPEAKER_09
 Wow.

0:59:46	SPEAKER_09
 The thing is, they're not as averse to wearing one of these.

0:59:49	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, they're on the radio, right?

0:59:51	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:59:52	SPEAKER_09
 I think that would be fantastic, because those kind of panels and those have interest in.

0:59:56	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:59:58	SPEAKER_09
 That's a side of a style that we're not collecting here.

1:00:01	SPEAKER_06
 And the other side to it, which is where we're coming from, I'll talk to you more about later, is that there's...

1:00:08	SPEAKER_06
...the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably related to illegal issues and permissions and all that.

1:00:20	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, they already do what they do.

1:00:23	SPEAKER_06
 So it's another source.

1:00:27	SPEAKER_06
 So I think it's something we should look into. We'll collect what we collect here.

1:00:31	SPEAKER_06
 Hopefully, they will collect more UW also.

1:00:34	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe we have this other source, but yeah, I think it's not unreasonable to aim at...

1:00:40	SPEAKER_06
...getting significantly in excess of 100 hours.

1:00:43	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, that was sort of our goal.

1:00:45	SPEAKER_06
 The thing was, I was hoping that we could...

1:00:47	SPEAKER_06
...in the under this controlled situation, we could at least collect, you know, 30 to 50 hours.

1:00:52	SPEAKER_06
 And if the rate we're going, we'll get pretty close to that, I think, this semester.

1:00:57	SPEAKER_06
 And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should...

1:01:01	SPEAKER_09
 Right, yeah, I was mostly trying to think, okay, you start a project within, say, a month.

1:01:07	SPEAKER_09
 How much data do you have to work with?

1:01:10	SPEAKER_09
 You want to sort of freeze your data for a while.

1:01:15	SPEAKER_09
 So right now, and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM.

1:01:19	SPEAKER_09
 Well, we don't have it for this, you know, 45 minutes that way.

1:01:22	SPEAKER_09
 So not complaining, I was just trying to think, what kinds of projects can you do now,...versus six months from now, and they're pretty different.

1:01:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so I've seen it right now. It's sort of this exploratory stuff where you look at the data, you do some primitive measures, and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like.

1:01:37	SPEAKER_06
 Right, right.

1:01:38	SPEAKER_06
 And meanwhile, we collect, and then it's more like, yeah, three months from now or six months from now, you can do a lot more.

1:01:44	SPEAKER_09
 Because I'm not actually sure just logistically that I can spend...

1:01:47	SPEAKER_09
 I don't want to charge the time that they have on the project too early before there's enough data to make good use of the time.

1:01:54	SPEAKER_09
 And especially with the student, for instance, this guy who seems to...

1:01:58	SPEAKER_09
 Anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but if someone came that was great, and wanted to do some real work, and they have to end by the end of the school year in the spring, how much data will I have to work with that person?

1:02:10	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

1:02:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so I would think exploratory things now.

1:02:13	SPEAKER_06
 Three months from now, I mean, the transcriptions are...

1:02:16	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, the transcriptions, I think, are a bit unknown, because we haven't gotten those back yet, as far as the timing.

1:02:20	SPEAKER_06
 But I think, as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me unreasonable to say that, in January, roughly, just roughly three months from now, we should have at least something like 25, 30 hours.

1:02:36	SPEAKER_06
 So that's...

1:02:37	SPEAKER_09
 And you just don't know about the transcription part of that.

1:02:39	SPEAKER_09
 And we need to...

1:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think that there's the possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted after words and...

1:02:45	SPEAKER_02
 especially since these people won't be used to dealing with multi-channel transcription.

1:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 So I think that we'll need to adjust some...

1:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 And also, if we want to add things like...

1:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 well, more refined coding of overlaps than definitely, I think we should count on having extra pass through.

1:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 I wanted to ask another aspect of the data collection.

1:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 There'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several, you know, friends and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?

1:03:13	SPEAKER_06
 If they really have something they want to talk about as opposed to something...

1:03:16	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real...

1:03:21	SPEAKER_06
 Why not?

1:03:22	SPEAKER_06
 I'm thinking...

1:03:23	SPEAKER_06
 Stakes in political debates?

1:03:24	SPEAKER_09
 Well, yeah, or just if you're...

1:03:28	SPEAKER_09
 If you have...

1:03:29	SPEAKER_09
 There are meetings here that happen that we can record, even if we don't...

1:03:33	SPEAKER_09
 have them do the digits, or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing.

1:03:37	SPEAKER_09
 Like, you know...

1:03:38	SPEAKER_08
 We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to.

1:03:39	SPEAKER_09
 One string of digits is something that probably will indeed.

1:03:43	SPEAKER_09
 Then having the data is very valuable, because I think it's politically better for us to say we have as many hours of audio data, especially with the ITR, if we put in a proposal, it'll just look like EXU's collected a lot more audio data, whether it's transcribed or not, is another issue, but there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can start to answer.

1:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like you could hold some meetings, you know, and maybe you could hold some additional meetings.

1:04:13	SPEAKER_07
 Would it help at all?

1:04:14	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, we're already talking about sort of two levels of detail, and meetings.

1:04:19	SPEAKER_07
 One is without doing the digits...

1:04:23	SPEAKER_07
 I guess the full-blown one is where you did the digits and everything, and then talk about doing it without digits.

1:04:29	SPEAKER_07
 What if we had another level just to collect data, which is without the headsets, and we just did the table amount.

1:04:35	SPEAKER_07
 We need the close-talking line.

1:04:37	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, absolutely.

1:04:39	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I'm really scared.

1:04:40	SPEAKER_08
 It seems like it's a big part of this corpus, is that what it was like?

1:04:42	SPEAKER_09
 Or at least, like me personally, I couldn't use that data.

1:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and Murray also, we had this camera-bunship issue here, that's important.

1:04:50	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

1:04:51	SPEAKER_09
 So it's a great idea, and if it were true, then I would just do that, but it's not that bad.

1:04:54	SPEAKER_09
 Like, the room is not the bottleneck, and we have enough time in the room, and it's getting the people to come in and put on the...

1:05:01	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are actually, in the long run, such a big bottleneck.

1:05:07	SPEAKER_06
 I think the issue is just that we're blazing that path.

1:05:11	SPEAKER_06
 And do you have any idea when you'd be able to send the...

1:05:18	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I've been burning two CDs a day, which is about all I can do with the time I have.

1:05:23	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

1:05:24	SPEAKER_08
 So it'll be early next week.

1:05:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, okay.

1:05:26	SPEAKER_06
 So early next week is sent it to them, and then we check with them to see if they've got it, and we start asking about timing for it.

1:05:33	SPEAKER_06
 So I think once they get sorted out about how they're going to do it, which I think they're pretty well long on, because they were able to read the files and so on, right?

1:05:41	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but...

1:05:42	SPEAKER_06
 Well...

1:05:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, when those were, they aren't.

1:05:44	SPEAKER_06
 Have they ever responded?

1:05:45	SPEAKER_06
 No.

1:05:46	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but, you know, so they have, you know, they're volunteering at time, and they have a lot of other things to do, right?

1:05:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, they have a lot of other things to do, right?

1:05:51	SPEAKER_06
 But anyway, though, I think once they get that sorted out, they're making cassettes there, and then they're handing it to someone who is doing it, and I think it's not going to be...

1:06:03	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think it's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do 30 hours than to do one hour.

1:06:07	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's not going to be 30- So it's the amount of...

1:06:10	SPEAKER_06
 It's just getting it going.

1:06:11	SPEAKER_08
 It's pipeline, pipeline issue.

1:06:12	SPEAKER_08
 So what's the pipeline?

1:06:13	SPEAKER_08
 What about these lunch meetings?

1:06:14	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, I don't know.

1:06:16	SPEAKER_09
 If there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to IBM, even if we just collected here for a while to record, you know, two or three more meetings a week, just to have the data, even if they're not doing the digits, but they do wear the...

1:06:31	SPEAKER_06
 But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up.

1:06:34	SPEAKER_09
 No, I meant...

1:06:35	SPEAKER_09
 Sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs, maybe they don't want to be recorded, but...

1:06:41	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, and we're just chatting?

1:06:42	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, we have a lot of the things.

1:06:44	SPEAKER_09
 Actually, I actually think that's useful data.

1:06:48	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, the problem with that is...

1:06:51	SPEAKER_08
 I think I would feel a little constrained to...

1:06:54	SPEAKER_08
 Okay, you know, some of them are soccer ball meetings.

1:06:57	SPEAKER_08
 I guess none of you were there for a soccer ball meeting.

1:06:59	SPEAKER_09
 Throw it out there with anyone knows of one more or two more meetings per week that happen at XC that we can record.

1:07:07	SPEAKER_09
 I think it would be worth it.

1:07:08	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well we should also check with Maria again, because they were really intending, maybe it just didn't happen, but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level.

1:07:18	SPEAKER_06
 So then that would double what we had.

1:07:22	SPEAKER_06
 And there's a lot of different meetings that UW mean really a lot more than we have here, because we're not right on campus.

1:07:30	SPEAKER_07
 Is the notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water?

1:07:34	SPEAKER_07
 They seem to have some problems,

1:07:36	SPEAKER_06
 whether we can talk about that later. But again, Jerry's open.

1:07:41	SPEAKER_06
 So I mean, we have two speech meetings, one network meeting.

1:07:46	SPEAKER_06
 Jerry was open to it, but I...

1:07:49	SPEAKER_06
 One of the things that I think is a little bit of a limitation there, is I think when people are not involved in our work, we probably can't do it every week.

1:07:58	SPEAKER_06
 I think that people are going to feel...

1:08:02	SPEAKER_06
 are going to feel a little bit constrained.

1:08:05	SPEAKER_06
 I might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time.

1:08:08	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:08:09	SPEAKER_06
 And so then they can just really sort of chart you, put the mics on, they just charge in.

1:08:13	SPEAKER_09
 What if we give people, you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here?

1:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 I do think eating while you're doing a meeting is going to be increasing my rights.

1:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 I had another question, which is, you know, in principle, I know that you don't want artificial topics, but it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial.

1:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we...

1:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 Political discussions or something, rather.

1:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, people who are...

1:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 Because, you know, there's also this constraint.

1:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's like, you know, the...

1:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 Goldy bars, Goldy blocks.

1:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's like, you don't want meetings that are too large, but you don't want meetings that are too small.

1:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 And it just seems like maybe we could exploit human subjects in the positive sense of...

1:09:03	SPEAKER_07
 Well, even, I mean, coming down from campus is sort of a big thing.

1:09:07	SPEAKER_07
 But what about...

1:09:08	SPEAKER_07
 Could pay subjects.

1:09:09	SPEAKER_07
 Or what about people in the building?

1:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't get it.

1:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 They need credit.

1:09:13	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I was saying there's only other people.

1:09:14	SPEAKER_07
 And, you know, there's a lot of people in California downstairs.

1:09:17	SPEAKER_08
 And I just really doubt that any state of California meetings would be recordable and then really so both of the general public.

1:09:23	SPEAKER_08
 So, I mean, I talked with some people at the Hoss Business School who are interested in speech recognition.

1:09:28	SPEAKER_08
 And they sort of hummed and said, well, maybe we could have some meetings down here, but then I got a email from them and said, no, we decide we're not really interested, and we don't want to come down to hold meetings.

1:09:38	SPEAKER_08
 So, I think it's going to be a problem to get people regularly.

1:09:41	SPEAKER_06
 But, yeah, I can maybe he can...

1:09:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we can get some scattered things from this and that.

1:09:45	SPEAKER_06
 And I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the radio.

1:09:49	SPEAKER_06
 I better context radio.

1:09:50	SPEAKER_06
 You can get a lot of lively discussions from those radio.

1:09:52	SPEAKER_09
 Well, and they're already...

1:09:54	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

1:09:55	SPEAKER_09
 These things are already recorded.

1:09:56	SPEAKER_09
 We don't have to ask them to.

1:09:58	SPEAKER_09
 Even, and I'm not sure how they recorded, but they must need some individual.

1:10:02	SPEAKER_06
 No, I'm not talking about ones that are already recorded.

1:10:04	SPEAKER_06
 I'm talking about new ones, because we would be asking them to do something different.

1:10:09	SPEAKER_09
 Well, we can find out...

1:10:11	SPEAKER_09
 I know, Princess Mark, living in this interested in L.D.C.

1:10:15	SPEAKER_09
 getting data...

1:10:17	SPEAKER_06
 Right, that's the found data idea.

1:10:19	SPEAKER_06
 But what I'm saying is, if I talk to people that I know who do these and who produce these things, we could ask them if they could record an extra channel, let's say, of a distant mic.

1:10:28	SPEAKER_06
 And I think routinely they would not do this.

1:10:32	SPEAKER_06
 So, since I'm interested in the distant mic stuff, I want to make sure that there is at least that somewhere.

1:10:37	SPEAKER_06
 But if we ask them to do that, they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they...

1:10:42	SPEAKER_06
 I might be able to talk them into it.

1:10:45	SPEAKER_08
 We're getting towards the end of our disc space, so we should think about...

1:10:48	SPEAKER_08
 Okay, well, why don't we...

1:10:49	SPEAKER_06
 When we...

1:10:50	SPEAKER_08
 Okay, leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, because that's what I mean.

1:10:54	SPEAKER_08
 Crash last time.

1:10:56	SPEAKER_06
 Turning off the microphone and crash.

1:10:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 Let's question them.

1:11:01	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.
