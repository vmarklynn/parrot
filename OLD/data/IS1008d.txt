0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome back everybody.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_00
 So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting and opening and PMs are secretary of the meet minutes prototype presentation from Christie and Agni.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_02
 Agni, yes.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 And evolution criteria, the finance it's from my side from the management and production evolution then closing.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 So we have 40 minutes to discuss and finalize and close the product and project and to move further.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 So let's talk about maybe first prototype.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 I've done a presentation but it pretty much covers work that we've both done.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 If I'm missing anything, Christie.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 So shall I go to correct me?

0:01:45	SPEAKER_03
 So you did a PowerPoint presentation.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Let's go to MI.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 In 2003 or?

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 Free.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's the last one.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 Technical.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 I would say.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 No, then that one.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_03
 Technical design.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 It is named appropriately.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 You just couldn't see the name.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 Can I have a minute?

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 So from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 The material that we chose was wood and that the color would be customizable because you can stain the wood, whatever color.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 So in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the TV on and off, volume and channel control, menu control, voice recognition control.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 And we've incorporated the LCD screen on the panel as part of the design.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 If we figure out it's too expensive, well, then you just take it off.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 So to unveil our lovely product.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 This is our remote control with the flip panel, as you can see.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow LCD display.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_03
 This is actually hard to do.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it's really big, hard to miss.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 You have the red triangles or the toggles for changing the volume.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 So up, volume up, down, volume down.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 The green are the channel changing.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 And it's one of those very light, very touchable displays.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 And on the right hand side, you have the access to the menu on the TV.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 And on the left hand side, you have the ability to turn off the voice recognition.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 So this is pretty much what we had on the whiteboard the last time.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 And additional feature on the back is you can have your own customized backing.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_03
 And I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front, so that you can really make this a highly, highly customizable remote control.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 We haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_02
 That depends on the design of the circuit board inside and what room is left.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think the microphone is on the top.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, okay.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Under the flip.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 So that will be the safe.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 So it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone out.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 No, it depends on the design of the circuit board.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 But it shouldn't be under the flip either because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but my opinion, I think it's about under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, okay, so then you can speak, then you can close it.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_00
 Because if you put it on the flip, okay, then technical, I don't think it's feasible because most of the time you speak, then it will be recognized.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 If you've already got the remote control in your hand, I need to open the flip to use the voice.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 Why use the voice?

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 Why not just use your hand?

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up, I can just use my voice.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 You don't want to let go of either one.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, it doesn't have to be on the flip.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 It can be on the sides somewhere.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 The sides may be good.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's good, I mean, I can pass this around if anyone wants to.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, the sides may be a good idea.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 Very fast around with the napkin.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 You can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem, would have not been damaged or anything and it'd be accessible all the time to a voice.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 The sides may be a good idea.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's a compliment to the artist.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's, you need to work on the weight a little bit.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe the shape of the buttons.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'm satisfied.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 The little egg shapes aren't the most eaten.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 We're glad your satisfied.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 It looks more heavy, but I think when it comes to the reality, maybe it's the less weight.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is plasticine.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 There's only so much you can do.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 And part of the thing is a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light because they don't feel like they have enough control over it.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, maybe this is excessively heavy, but I think it needs to have some weight.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 It needs to feel like you're still holding something.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 So that's pretty much it for our presentation, actually.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's your prototype, Maudet.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, that's good.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 So any comments or?

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the prototype is very well within the design and idea that we've talked about on the previous meetings.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Now it goes into this next phase as a financial marketing.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that's right.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'll come back to the...

0:07:30	SPEAKER_00
 So, evolution criteria, I think that will be good.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 So when it's come to the finance, I have some calculations which I made as for the budget.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 So here you can look like the energy source and handy dynamo and kinetic and solar cells.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's optional, some are optional and advanced chip on print.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 That's what we were talking about that.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have the wood material, then special color and push button.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 So it's... actually our budget was 12.5 euro, but it's coming to 9.95 euro.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 So we are under below the budget.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so still we are saving some money.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good figure.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, great.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_02
 I'm surprised.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 Congratulations.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we haven't covered the money yet, so we're going to go with the rest of the print.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 You've got a lot of money to market it.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe for some money we can utilize for our marketing for the sales.

0:08:56	None
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it just depends.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 If we're going to add on this provisionary cost analysis, we do not have an LCD display.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 LCD display is going to be very expensive.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 No, we do, but it's not filled in.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's not necessarily.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have the price up there.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 So if we add approximately 2 to 3 euro per remote, now we're up around about 12, 12 and a half as to what the company had initially requested.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 That means we can put the...

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Display in.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 But as far as production, I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 And in mine, you'll see the problem with our survey, the possibility of how many units can be sold or percentages of the market, et cetera, et cetera, because that has to be taken into consideration.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is just production cost.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 It is not advertising cost.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's not transportation cost.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 So still we have 2.5 minutes.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 And that will inflate quite a bit on the cost of the unit for the company.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 So to come up with what the company wants is a 50 million pound profit, we're going to have to go a long way.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_00
 This we are talking about one unit.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 So then it's going to the quantity and the cost will come down slightly.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 Although customization, because this is being done on an order basis, might be the quantity you want, the circuit board, you're right, would be in producing quantity, but the cost of the case would be fixed.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 You got some pretty cheap labor that can do this case for one euro.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's the cost of material and it's really outstanding.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 But anyhow, still we are under control.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 So what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors to get the production cost less so that we can save some money to put it into our marketing or the promotions, whatever.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 So that I will look after.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 I will speak to the management and how to get some more cost down.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 If we can go to my display and we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 So now I'm going to scare everybody out of this project.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 If I'm still here, press the button.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 You're in full?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 The forward gives me a try and watch.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's the same one you did before.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 It shouldn't be if it's not the right one.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's the same one.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 You have to go back and find another one.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever name it popped up under.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 So functional.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 Try function on might not be it either, but we'll see.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 It looks like it.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go screen by screen.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Since we need to have some type of idea on the market, we had an independent study that says that this market has an availability to absorb 8 million units per year.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Our internal company evaluation puts it between 8 to 9 million, which is approximately the same as the independent study.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 So if we continue, we look at the findings.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 Next screen.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Which means that if we have a target of 2 million, the company has to take 25% of the market in the first year, which is actually a tremendous amount.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 No kidding.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 I admit they already expected some.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 So if we put an inflated price of 50 year old at a production cost, they cannot exceed 25 year old.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 We're already in that price.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 With transport promotion labor, because we haven't included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever, however, we're going to break this down between our retailers.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 25% of the market to get to 2 million units, we have to have a profit of 25 year old per unit to get to the 50 million year old profit.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 So obviously, I just did a rundown of the evaluation of the form, the fancy stylishness of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we've gone through these.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Now the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify a production.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 Or we project this over two years by being that the market changes very, very quickly.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in 18 months from now.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 So now we have to come up with a decision.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Can the company sell 2 million units?

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 Can it sell it for 50 year olds?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 Could I go to findings?

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery in sales channel, which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the product to the customers, residents.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 That way you have no storage, you do have transportation, you still have the labor cost, but you don't have the transport to the point of sale.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 The point of sale is online.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 You can do a shipping center somewhere or strategically place shipping centers.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 To minimize distance costs.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 You should sell through Amazon, don't you?

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 Or eBay, yeah.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:04	None
 Yeah.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 That's an idea.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 Going with the un...

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 To improve more profit and...

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 Upscale technology.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, we're selling a unique product.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 It actually makes more sense if we're going to make it so highly customizable because on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibilities are.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's some companies that come that way.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_03
 Where you can't...

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 Unless you're a highly imaginative person, you may not really know what it is you want.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas on the web, if you have a bunch of pictures, it can trigger ideas and you can

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 even have a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the... The only thing that you're missing really is the weight.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 The weight, the feel of the product but...

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 We're getting used to that.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's not quite like trying on a shoe but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 Several that have gone through with the watches too.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 You can customize the watch.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 You can see how it is at the end of the production.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can change it.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 There's a lot of online that is doing this now.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 You're rotating and you look behind and look this way.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible to do this.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe there's a possibility of selling more than 2 million units in one year which could feasibility lower the price of the unit.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think that's not possible.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's...

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, then let's wait for the production.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_00
 Then you can evaluate the product.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_00
 So how it looks like technically and how it looks like the real.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 What turnaround time do we have?

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Because I mean production evaluation can be very, very quick or very, very long.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's very quick.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 It will come back in two weeks.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 It will work in two weeks.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Works for me.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_00
 For evolution.

0:16:58	None
 Okay.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 Prototypes you mean?

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 The prototype.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Prototype product evolution.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 That should do some market tests once we have prototypes.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well obviously.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 And just some orders and things like that.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And test market it.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 You might have to be throwing out on the market for people to get an idea to see.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_00
 So you can take the minimum two weeks.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 Get there.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 Get the maximum four weeks.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 Minimum two weeks if we're going to develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's not trivial tests.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because we are not going to do it in all five three.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we can get the product chosen.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_00
 We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 So we will do it in the other place.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't think it's take more than four weeks time.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_00
 So then the real production we will start once we product evolution.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 Then it's approved from the technical team and your team.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 From the management.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Then we can launch in the market.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Any outstanding.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 Any other questions or comments to be discussed?

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 No, I think we've pretty much covered everything.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 So then.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Did you have something?

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 I was just wondering about if we're going to do product evaluation, then what about time for redesign?

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 If the users come back and tell us, no, this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently.

0:18:27	None
 Okay.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 Let's take like this, let's proceed with this model for the market introduction.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 So no more changes will be made in this, the basic design.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 So we will introduce this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 Then we can go for the.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 Second generation.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Second generation.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 There is no end, there is no limit.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_03
 The problem is it may not be a second generation of the first generation flops for some silly reason.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 Every customer, okay, they have the right idea.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 They have the wrong taste.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 So there is no end, there's no limit.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 No, but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work, but we don't really have anything to back it up.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 It was very specific.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so that's the reason you're here for the design.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you made a good design.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but I'm not everybody.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 We have our own motivations in mind.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 We have our own ideas in mind, but that doesn't mean that that's what's going to sell.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but see, we have to take a few considerations.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 One is the price consideration, one is the future consideration.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can eat, you can order it more chill.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 I can eat more chilli.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_00
 So it depends on individual taste.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 You know, so we have to balance somewhere.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you have no redesign, not you personally, but in the project, we have no redesign time.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Ed, do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for TV remote control sales?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 Would it be the Christmas season by any chance?

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 The sports time.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 Sports season.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Right before the year.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 The world cup.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 The world cup soccer.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 The world cup soccer.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 They need those things.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 They have a hand occupied and they need to be able to talk to the remote control.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronize the final, the launch of a user tested device with some special event.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then, so that gives us a little more time perhaps than we anticipated because I don't know when the world cup is, but I'm sure there's going to be one.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 Or any major sports.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 Or another major sports event.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_02
 Probably not the football game is coming up the end of January.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think that might be a little too aggressive.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 But so I'm just pointing out a strategy to do some additional user testing and then to launch at a major sports event or perhaps to also.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good place to advertise it too.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 And to work with motion pictures, there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on DVD that they need to have a special remote control to work with it so we could maybe work out a campaign with Sony pictures for example.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe some management has got relationships there.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 We can leverage.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that of course I will convince the management to do that.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's great.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's just something to keep in mind because it's really, really important.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user tested and completely flopped when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 Really?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 One of the first consumer products that was launched about 30 years that was a disposable consumer product and people at the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away because it wasn't.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 But then when they relaunched them 30 years later, they were virtually the same design but people had gotten to throw away paper cups and napkin, all kinds of things that they hadn't.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 So you're right, timing is very important but I think we've got a good product.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's the reason Ed is here.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think you can promote the brand value and the product value.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be very important to the company.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 We are behind the scene and he's a friend screen so.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 I have no idea what he's doing.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Good luck Ed.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's a flop, it's the marketer.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 You look very relaxed.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 Considering the place on your shoulders.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so then let's come to the closing.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 Celebration.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 The cost within the budget and is the project evaluated?

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so that will come soon.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but time being, thanks for all your efforts and great work and great design and let's leave it to the ad later for once production is over.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 And I mean that I'm let's celebrate.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 So let's meet up this evening to hang up for some party.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds good.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
