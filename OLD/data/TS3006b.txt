0:00:00	None
 it's not even cheap greenhouse Editor for that reason.

0:00:04	None
 No.

0:00:20	None
 Ah yeaahahah.

0:00:22	None
!

0:00:24	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't see it yet I think.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_00
 Did I miss something?

0:00:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, pretty much.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_02
 I thought I'd come and mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, what's wrong with my computer?

0:00:55	None
 It's an iconita who is telling you.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's my presentation.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, right.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, everybody ready?

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, I'm not a good player.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, where do I find this?

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not a good player.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 And then, I'm a paradise.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 You read the new flash?

0:01:44	SPEAKER_02
 No, what was it?

0:01:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, press it.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no, but my screen is reduced in size.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 Feedback?

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'll delete.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't draw the attention away.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 I made my own map.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 No, not this, but the task.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 No, I just flipped it, close it, took it here and then this happened.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 And that's not the way it's.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 Where was it?

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's settings.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, all right.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_03
 Do you guys like your task?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_03
 I get my function, you know, the information that I need.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 So frustrating.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't like the end and just typing it to that.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I have to do that.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_03
 So, this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas because I hadn't time to integrate the information yet.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 Really annoying.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm going to talk about functional requirements.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 Well, some research has been done, has been done, observing of 100 subjects and usability lab using the remote control.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 They also fill in a questionnaire.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 The findings were, well, you can see them for yourself.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 They dislike to look at field current remote controls.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_01
 They're ugly.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 They do not match the operating behavior of the user, so they don't match what they want to have on it.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 They're often lost somewhere in the room.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 And they're bad for error's eye.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how a user can read that, but okay.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 There was also research on the most relevant and irrelevant functions.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 Most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono stereo, pitch, bass, screen settings for brightness and color and stuff like that.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 But they are used.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 They do need to be under remote control.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 And if you can't control the sound settings, I mean, if you dislike a very loud bass or something, you need to change that.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 If he doesn't have an equalizer.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, we can't, my TV has, but we can leave them away.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 Most relevant and most used functions, they speak for themselves, I guess.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 Power button, channel volume selection, daily text, but we can skip that because I saw the new slash and daily text is so outdated that it should not be used anymore in the future.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 So forget this one and channel settings.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 So for programming your channels in the right order.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 Where did you guys get that new slash?

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I didn't get anything.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 On the project.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 Not by mail.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 I received mail, but you don't.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, so it's a text file in the project folder.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 So daily text can be skipped.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 That's in the presentation.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 There was some research on new features in the remote control about an LCD screen and speech recognition.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we got an update for the audience or the targeted group.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 So it's above 40, I guess.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 The new product or below.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's pretty relevant.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 I thought our ads.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Our current customers are in the age group 40 plus.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 And the new product should reach new markets.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 Below.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's in the new.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's good to know.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because you see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 And above 40 people are not so interested in the screen or speech recognition.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_01
 But below that age they pretty much are.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we can build that in.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, we can skip this part as well because I thought our ad above 40.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 So we could skip the features, but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 And also, so not only the design of the buttons but how you can push them and stuff like that.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the physical aspect of it.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 And I think certainly for the lower age groups, a nice design.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 Which does not make the remote control or no to stay in your room.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually a part of your interior of your design in your room.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 So the people can say, whoa, what's that?

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's my remote control.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 So it has to look nice and feel nice and have all the functions.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 But it also needs to have corporate identity.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 So the logo has to be present and the colors as well.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 We can change much of that.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 Two years.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a color anyway.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 And most of the time there is a brand present on it.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that's not going to affect it very much.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 But that are the consequences of the marketing part.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's open already so you can use all top.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you're here.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 You pressed all the four?

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 I pressed the mouse button.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, great.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's a self-destruct button.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can do it from your computer.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 And if you go stand around here.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's nice.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_00
 I had two examples.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 This one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 This is the easy one.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to combine them.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, merge the best functions of all examples.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, the H is under 40.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 And marketing research stated that that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 So not too much.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 We do have to integrate the screen and the speech recognition.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 This one we can remove for kids.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's just only for adults.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 So we can use some advanced options.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 From age of 16.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_00
 But I prefer we use the basic options.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 We have to make them very easy.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 So for just zipping around channels, you can just push one button.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 But if you want to use your video recorder or something else, you should use an advanced option.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 But the news flash also stated that it should control only one device.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 So only your television.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 So it's very easy.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 Now, yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 So there are not extra options in this case.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 Also, yeah.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 We have to make it fashionable.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:02	None
 You want to set it before.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 The basic functions.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 Only use the extra functions if they are really needed.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe you can hide them or something.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 You can put that in the screen.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Screen menu to do that.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 And then the basic function just under defies itself.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen with a clear menu.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, functionality is the screen.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 What does the screen do?

0:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's low on power.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 What are they?

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 So what does the screen do?

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 They said they needed it.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_02
 What does it do?

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 What do they want?

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 For the advanced functions, I think.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it didn't say what they want to do with the screen.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 My guess is pretty handy for advanced functions.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Searching for channels.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 Searching for channels.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Programming them.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Nevermind.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'm almost finished.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 We have to watch out for the, if we make it very fashionable, the functionality will go down.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashion.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 Complement them for them.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 That was the end.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, my presentation is a bit sucky.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can improvise, right?

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, a little bit.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think there are requirements?

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that will be it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 So we can go for it.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_03
 That was, you know, you know.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 Let me check.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's not really English.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 The kickoff.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 Our working design.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 We got it.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 So we can go for the look and feel of the left example and then a screen on top of it.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 Here you go.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_03
 How do I skip pages?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 Just press the keys.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I was working on this before I got my information.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_03
 So I was just working off the top of my head using my common knowledge about remote controls and, well, the info on the website, which came to it.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 This is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 Those were my starting points.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 I was working on a, yeah, on a schedule and I was supposed to do it like this, but, yeah.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 So I was trying to organize them for myself and then make the design, the design, the actual design, but I never came around to do that.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, everything speaks for itself, I guess.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you press a button, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequency.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, frequency.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 And our temporal frequencies, actually, and then through a transformer, the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the TV to feel translated into the function.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, this was actually all I got around to do.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't know if I'm too slow for this stuff, but then work harder.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Should we make a list of all the functions we want to...

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we want to incorporate into it.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, for those that didn't see yet, the basic new requirements of the management were no-time text, only for TV.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 It should be designed for a user group below 40, but I don't think it's wrong if we can target the current customer group as well.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 And we have to decide on the functions and on the...

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see, what was it?

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 The target group.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have to make me clear what that is.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 The target group of users?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it uses.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because it says below 40, I mean...

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think it's easy, but...

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or male and female.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Or in just...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's below 40.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 The marketing research started on the age of 16, 16 to 25, 25 to 35, 35 to 45, something like that.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 So below 40 is okay, but we need an lower level in which to...

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 How do you miss?

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 So is it from 16 to 40?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Is it from 20 to 40?

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's from 16 to 40.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 I guess people of 16 are quite used to technology.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 So they adapted pretty soon, I guess.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 If we have a larger public, we have more options to sell our product.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so what we might want to do is...

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, have customized the screen functions, if you know what I mean.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 Younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines, they can use more advanced functions, but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 So they need a simpler remote.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 And that you can choose what the design displays or whatever.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's right, I wanted to make two different groups of functions.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 The simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 But they all incorporate it in the screen or just on the remote itself.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_00
 I should put the advanced options onto the screen display.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like you have a visual of the brightness with a sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and visuals.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 You should have a menu for all the issues.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Make a drawing.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Select.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's okay.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 That's very big.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we get there.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, this is basically a remote.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 Usually the power button is on top, I guess.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 It should fit right into your hand.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Most people are right-handed, so maybe less than a special decision, but okay.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 If you put it like here or something, I don't know.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 Then you can put a screen on a mobile phone, also on top, I guess.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but if you are using the normal functions, the basic functions, you normally do this.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb, also reach the middle, or you should screen at the bottom.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Then you can see it very clearly.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you have your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the layouts.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't work too well.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you get it.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you put all the...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 You want the normal piece of paper and there's a 10?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, my piece is...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of works.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 Like if you have 10 buttons for all the channels, an ear button for flipping.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_00
 And the following?

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 That's usually like here, here, here, here.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we have up and down for the channels.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Left and right.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Left and right for the volume.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 Those can also be used for the menu.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 But this is really your department that we need just functional displays.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And for a cursor, this is function.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_01
 And you...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 If you can use the...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time you have one button in the middle.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 It says menu.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then if you press it, the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 And left and right to go into a function.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then just...

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time this menu button is also like, okay, to confirm a kind of action.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 So you scroll into it, okay, you select a function like base.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 You just adjust it with these two buttons.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 Then okay to confirm.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then on each screen, this should be an option to go back to an upper level.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then finally say, okay, exit or one button to exit it.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 In one time, I don't know that's not really my department.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's more your department too.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's a logo on the remote control.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 But it should be if the screen is here, then the logo should be on top.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's...

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but that depends on where you put the screen.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's essential that there is a screen.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the position of the screen is also more essential than...

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need the microphone.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be...

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you have it in your hand here, it should be on top somewhere.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 Why do we want to put the display in the bottom?

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's not sure.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's not sure, but...

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you use the functions, your hand will block the display.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 But that's only for the basic function.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 If you are going to use the iPhone option, you are going to press the menu button and then...

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the screen on top looks more...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 Normal.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 Logical to me also because people use mobile phones and they also have a screen on top.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you grab it...

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Once it's on, it's on.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 But most of the times, if a TV is on standby, people just press the check.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we put it on top.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we put this on top and then make the corporate logo like over here, R-R.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 And the microphone, I mean, it can be very small if you look at your mobile phone.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 So these are some stripes, little holes.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe on the top or even on the side.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe on the side, I mean, if the microphone is good...

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 So on the top is better.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 But if you hold the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side, I don't know.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 It should be able to...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't...

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, leave this up to you.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it doesn't matter that much.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 But the screen is on top.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 Which functions did we have left?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, this is basically numbers for you.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 For you.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 For you.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Channel up and down.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Channel up and down.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 Up there.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Outphones options.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should decide what outphones options we want to put in the LCD screen.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good one.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 So we needed to integrate those sound and image options, right?

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Like...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Sound.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Sound.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 So we need kind of an equalizer.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_01
 Equalizer.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have sound.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 But not too advanced.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 Most TVs use only treble and bass.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Treble and middle bass or something.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty hard to write.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 But you have sound?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 Sound.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 You have a digital...

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 Better write it down over there.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we have sound.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 Just a...

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 Secret.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_01
 Sound.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 Within sound, I guess, treble and bass.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 The mono stereo option.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 And also...

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 There was something else also.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 Pitch.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 Pitch.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 But pitch isn't that...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the height.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 The frequency is down.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Why would you use that?

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't this...

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 It depends on the signal of the program you're watching.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 And also the tuning part?

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 Programming part.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Channel programming.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 So we have sound, yeah.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Channel programming.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 In the functionality of the...

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 Telefician.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 Of the remote.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 Do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 As a confirmation?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 Or whatever, you know?

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think it gets annoying.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, most mobile phones use that in the beginning.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can disable...

0:25:46	SPEAKER_03
 Under the advanced option.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 You can put those in.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 The...

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 The telefician itself has also the options with brightness and screen color, etc.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 Contrast.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 But people don't want to sit underneath...

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 Underneath in front of the telefician which is usually only three buttons and it's very hard to.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast and brightness.

0:26:10	None
 Point.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's the most used, I guess, if you don't get your money turned.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, I guess this were the only ones, I guess.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 But so we have...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 We have TV options which is all this.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 The sound...

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 The options.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 The sound image.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 And you have in the...

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 The...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Indeed.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 The remote control options.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we need two menus kind of thing.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 You have basically a button menu which you can use directly.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 According to the opris port and the LCD options.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_02
 Are activated based on some software options that's communicated with the infrared.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 With the chip and then trans...

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 So you have an additional processor in.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well...

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 We have power button, whether that's present.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 Channel volume selection present.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 Numbers present.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 Audio settings, monosterior pitch, bass, treble, screen settings, brightness and color.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast this.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 Color and brightness.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 And which is a channel setting.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 So channel programming.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 And when it encounters one.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it shows on your TV.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 Uh...

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can select a number in your remote.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 So the channel program is auto-seek.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 Auto-seek.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Uh...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 Name a channel.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 Or...

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, most TVs automatically display the name which they get through the cable.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, they get the ultimate name.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 So you only have to choose the position on your...

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 It only has to match the channel frequency on your TV.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 With the position on your TV.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 And so your remote.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 But can you also say I want Veronica on the channel number 5?

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you already programmed it.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to move it.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 That should be possible too.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 How do you call that?

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 How do you call that?

0:28:27	None
 Mmm.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you should be able to browse through a list or something which displays all the values, all the channels which are possible.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_01
 I mean like 1 to 30 or 4.9 here or whatever.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 Just browse through it and then...

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:28:45	SPEAKER_01
 Some kind of way.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 See if it is programmed.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 Swap channels?

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 Swap channels.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 Swap is good option.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 So most of the time, if you swap it.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 Let's say for example you have RTL5 on channel 5.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 And Veronica on channel 8 and you want to move Veronica to channel 5.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time you overwrite the previous one.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's sort of...

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty...

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you have to look on the menu.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Those are working.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 On the TV.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 Also.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 He only has to figure out how it has to look.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 The working design was to specify how the physical interaction between the components was.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 I...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 It treated your homework.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 But um...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 Or is it too hard to just do it on your remote to program the channels?

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 It should be able to do a thing with the television is difficult.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 But that's not our part.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have to design protocol.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 Thank God.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to figure out a way to do that easily.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the auto-secret is not a problem.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 You are a counter-channel and then it just says on which number do you want to save this?

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 And you just press the number on your remote and then say confirm.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 And it's safe.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's easier.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to swap.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to think of something for that.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface design can design a menu for all the use functions.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of structure into layers.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 I mean you make a map with all the...

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because it's now...

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 There are also documents.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I can.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just try to reorganize things.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 And the layout of the thing itself.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think the layout of the screen.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think you can concentrate more on the bit and placement and the placement of the screen itself on the...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 Isn't that more than the...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 This is the interface.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think there's more in...

0:31:32	SPEAKER_03
 All the functional aspects of the...

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe more than...

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think I am in my department.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 I have to know what it has to do.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_03
 So if you want to...

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 You know, the changing the channels kind of thing is...

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 I have to integrate that in the design.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 So you lay out your function.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_02
 One function, okay.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good example.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_00
 I have to make the menu layout also.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 I guess so.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's your department.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_02
 We have to kind of work together.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 If I make the...

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 The menu, like...

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 I have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it in the way that is your friend.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 You are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the menu screen.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm going to make a nice menu.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 With some layers in it.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 And also...

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 Make clear which buttons to press to get certain results.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 Because that's always difficult to every device that's on...

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 I guess this button, the okay menu, okay.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 Or you can incorporate two different buttons like you have on your mobile phone.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 So this is only to get in the menu or to exit it.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 And then I want to confirm.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 I want to go one step back.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like the the say button on your mobile phone if you have a Nokia or like that or the no button.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 To go one step back, it's only two extra buttons.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 If it's very clear that they are for the screen.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to make two groups.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 One group for the display and one group for the basic functions.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but they're incorporated.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because this is used for both.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe that's not...

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 If you're zapping with your remote control, you can press the menu button and then you are suddenly into the...

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 To your screen.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you should leave the menu button out of here.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 And just put it under the screen.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_00
 Just group.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we make these advanced functions and these basic functions.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 We make a line between them.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 But we should place the screen on top, right?

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, oh yeah, okay.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 We swap the...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 You use the port.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you just find out and then the headlady is out.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 Do we do the extra two buttons or not?

0:34:20	SPEAKER_03
 I think you should.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's easier if you put too many functions in one button, it gets confusing.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, that's true.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 So we have a menu button and a...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, in Beck.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, in Beck.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, our confirm and back.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 The four arrows.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 But those are still doubly used.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 Should we save this picture or, you know, what it looks like?

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm not clear about the extra two buttons.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 We have a menu button.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 Just to activate the screen.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 So you button access the menu in the LCD screen.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then with these buttons, you can navigate.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 You navigate.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_02
 But you can also navigate the channels and the volume.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so that's not...

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, those are both... both.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, is it interesting for users if we put lead lights under the buttons so that if you...

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Press on the menu function, that only the buttons that are used for the menu are...

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 Liden up, yeah.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's very good ID.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a good ID because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:35:43	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else?

0:35:44	SPEAKER_01
 Those buttons are lit up.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 But just one thing.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Should we use those two then?

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 Or only this two to scroll?

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 And then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no, we have to use this to adjust...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 Or some some bars.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_03
 Or keep it optional because maybe you can... you know, go left, right and up and down.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should use this also as an okay button still.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then just only a back button.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we have those buttons.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 The problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 If you're pressing up and down, you can easily press it okay once you're not already at your...

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe make one okay button...

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 And one back.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 And one navigation button.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_00
 With the channel and the volume.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_00
 A multifunctional navigation button.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we decided.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 You want to close down?

0:36:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_02
 I want to close down.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_02
 Not because it doesn't like you.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_02
 But we have lunch break already.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can work for 30 minutes.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_02
 We'll have to write very fast to make the minute.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll see.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_03
 How long is the lunch break?

0:37:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 We have to ask all of me.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have to write down our stuff now?

0:37:13	SPEAKER_00
 First lunch break.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_00
 I believe that's first lunch break.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_00
 Everything in my head now.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_00
 There you go.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can put a laptop back in the room.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, sir.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_02
 Time pressure.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a lot of pressure.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry for my not finished presentation.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 We'll kick your ass later.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 Bring it on.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it works.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 You saved it.

0:37:48	None
 That's safe.

0:37:49	None
 Out of my head.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 Just shoot back my laptop.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 Smart board.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can use it.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 You can open it with picture preview or stuff like that.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_00
 Some maps with all the data we have.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 I tried to organize it by these three.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's just my own map.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really mind.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_02
 I just put the minutes here.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_00
 But you've got some actual information.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's in the functional design.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's just basically what I just showed.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Where do you get?

0:38:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_00
 I got it by the only one.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad you're here.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't do it.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:38:46	None
 Yeah.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_02
 Make me proud.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try to.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_03
 So first we have a lunch break now.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_02
 I believe so.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, just ask.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know where she's at though.

0:39:07	None
 Okay.
