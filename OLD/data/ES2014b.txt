0:00:30	None
 and Right.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, so, where's the PowerPoint presentation?

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, I have PowerPoint.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, right.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we've got So, we've got new project requirements.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically, we've got three things.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 We've got 40 minutes in which to fill this meeting to discuss the various options.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 Three presentations.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_02
 We have a, I guess, we have a presentation.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 I see. Right. That's nice. No one from each of you.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 New project requirements. So, do we want to do the presentation first or do we want to?

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 I got three things, basically relating to the amount being only for TV.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 We discussed that last time.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 And in actual fact, I was pretty well put with any of these.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 In fact, actually, we're going to be forced over in a sense.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 We've got teletext outdated.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 Did you get any information on that?

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't. Right.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 And the corporate image was the final thing.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, I got that in email form.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Right. Okay. So, I guess if we go ahead with the, with the three presentations.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, we'll start with yourself on the basis that.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry. Yep.

0:03:43	None
 Oh.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm a question.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 Usually a little thing at the top, right?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, hang on.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 This is good.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I got it.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 I passed it all five times now.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's be one.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's go again.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 Where's it going?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 I should be at this point.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's go again.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I'm going to be looking at the working design of the remote control.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 I've just got three sections for this.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 The research I made on the remote control itself.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 And then that involves the components required in the systems design of the actual device.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 So having researched the existing models within the market, my primary research of the internet, I've established what the components required for the remote control to function at HDR.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you wanted to do and how it connects with the television.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 The basic components are an energy source, which I guess, in most of these models will be a battery supply, where for that will be two batteries, four batteries, and it may vary.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 We then have a user interface, which is basically the buttons on the actual remote.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 The various functions you saw, changing channel, channel left and down one, is that that.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 There's also a chip inside the remote, which does all the computer type things.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 And then a sender, which is usually found in infrared device, which sends a signal to the actual television.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 And the nice part is the receiver, which is important in the system, but it's not actually part of the remote itself, because that's obviously found in the television.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 And I've actually drawn the board because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get into working, so let's go see if it.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have a cloth to wipe this down with?

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 There's the rubber on the right, I think.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 Get rid of the magic.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 So we start off with a power supply, which is probably going to be the battery.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_02
 This is how the basic system works.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 So we have a new brush, and then sends the appropriate message to the sender.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the emotion that self-class composes the mode and how to work together. This is the user interface.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 This is the chip itself, which then sends the sender to the infrared.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then on the set, the thing we have on the television, we have a receiver.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the sender sends a message to the receiver.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 So the top is the power source, yes?

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 So moving on to personal preferences, as I've said, the battery seems the best option for the actual remote, just because of the size you don't know, a cable attached to the remote, it's not really remote.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 And then the sender in the infrared has been used quite successfully.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 If the battery is on reasonable power, they will seem to work for any way to have to be pointed directly at the television itself.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_02
 The battery is the in the sender.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so now more design.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_03
 Mine's not quite as complicated as all that.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 That's what we like to hear.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so I'm going to talk a bit about the technical functions design.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 So the basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set so that the desired function is performed.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 An example of the function could be to change the volume up or down, so obviously you need two different buttons for that.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 To change the channel, either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down, to switch the television on or off, maybe a standby button.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Here are two example results.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 By the look of it, the both have kind of play and fast forward rewind functions, so I think the incorporate a kind of video function, which we won't have to worry about.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 But as you can see, the left remote is quite busy looking, quite complicated, whereas the right remote is much simpler.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 It looks much more user friendly.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 So my personal preference would be the right remote. So it's got nice big buttons, it's got a very limited number of buttons.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 They're nice, kind of clearly labeled.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 I like the use of the kind of symbols, like the triangles and squares and arrows, as well as the words on the play functions and all that.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very user friendly. It's got a little splash of color. Could maybe do a small color.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's a couple of things there.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 We have to remember that we have our own logo and color scheme.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 So basically we'd have to be putting that on the product.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 Do we get to see that?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't as yet.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 But I got an email that basically said to make sure that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate color and slogan.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm guessing that I noticed on the bottom there it's got what's that EP-O-G-E-E that might be the corporate color scheme.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Although the only color I could see in that is the red.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Would you be able to get rid of the X-Men's here, the sort of circular section, setting three for a video as well?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 We could dispense with that a little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers in the volume.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 What we might have seen in section like all the examples in this one.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just a little bit is that I think that's still in my video.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 All my parts were made with the video as well.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't really think that I need nine numbers.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how often do you send me nine? I think just one six and then channel up and down.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, for general television purposes, obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time and we'd have to have some room for future such channels.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 As people used to seeing us, we didn't have them.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, possibly.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 But the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels and the process of taking place.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 Certainly the button up and down.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 But I mean, how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 I would have thought that the fact of it is forever expanding.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 And the moment we've got, although you've got the five standard, you've got the BBC have come up with a further six.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_00
 And there's, I don't know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 Sky and various other.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 And various others.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 So I would have thought that we wouldn't, you know, rather than.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, if the time of flicking from one to other, but presumably it'll take a second because you have to be able to stop it.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that and then you could dispense with more otherwise.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 You want, you want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 Some remote type kind of favorite options where if you always pick from channel one to channel six.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 If that's your favorite, you just bypass two to five.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose in a sense you could have them if you've got a hundred channels.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 Then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having one to a hundred, you could go one to ten, ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 Then that would cut down your time.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think a lot of them, like, keep on sky stuff, that would be true to one channel and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'd get a 55.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 Number of buttons.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 User friendly.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's called nine to not really accessible.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose you've got the last one which makes the talent to me.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's like multiple, so you can make any number.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 So with that we can buy from any problems with.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's true.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you could get 50 by five and a zero or whatever.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 That makes sense.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 Does that facilitate having all the numbers you could have in you?

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 That's...

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 So what was the circular thing that you were?

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's just for a video.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 So what wouldn't need any of that at all?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we get...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 If it's just for TV, which is what it is at the moment.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Whoa.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 Should we get to 100 buttons?

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 We've got ten, eleven, twelve.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 We've got fourteen that we need, I guess.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 Which isn't really the team, I'd be quite used to making these guys for the whole thing.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we've got this remote for TV only, otherwise Project would become too complex with which we'd endanger the time to market was one of the considerations.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Did you have that information being the marketing?

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Or was I meant to give you that information?

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 I had some more information.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 I had some more information.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 Right, no, from the company.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right, okay.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 So basically, time to market seems to be important.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 Therefore, speed of delivery.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 We've only got about another four hours left.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so is everyone happy with that?

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right, well, I asked the end of my presentation.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_04
 Please.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think you'll just give us a second to...

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think she's at twenty seconds to...

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure we'll have her hands to play.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, there we go.

0:18:21	None
 Yeah, there we go.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 Right, we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 And first off, we should state that the remote control is for controlling the TV.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 And how do people use it?

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 We ask them which buttons were useful for them.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 How does a remote control look and feel for them?

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 And what improvements would they like to remote control?

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 And we did that by giving them a questionnaire that we prepared and asking them to fill in the answers.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 And three-quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that even high proportion would spend more for a fancier remote control.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 And that, of all the buttons on the remote control, the setting buttons for the picture, picture and brightness and the audio settings, they weren't used very often at all.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 People concentrating on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked them about speech recognition for remote control.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 And young people were quite receptive to this.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 But as soon as we got sort of over about into 35 to 48, 45 age movement and older, people were quite so keen on speech recognition.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 There was a lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked what frustrated people about remote controls.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 And the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 But they couldn't find it.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 And the second biggest frustration was that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions and to find your way around it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so, what this is not a preference is from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek, sort of good looking, high tech, the design which looks high tech basically.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 And that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And we should sort of concentrate on the channels and power and also volume.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I think as Louise said, we could maybe come up with a menu, sort of an LCD menu for other functions on the remote control.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 And that's worth thinking about.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe we could think about speech recognition as well because some young people are perhaps the ones that are going to buy our new product if we aim it.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, sort of a high tech design.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 That might be the market that we're looking for.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, let me think about using speech recognition as well as a sign to control if it's lost in a room rather than sort of having it to speech recognition to change the channel.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 Because there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channels.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 And at the end of this slide, that's it.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, what was that last bit there? About speech recognition.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay. But that was only for young people that preferred it.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Older people did.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Young people.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 They said that they'd be interested in remote control, which offered that possibility.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 And as you go through the age groups, people have got less and less interested in sort of a remote control that you can talk to.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think it seems the technology would be quite advanced and it might end up casting more than a 1250 budget.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 And possibly thinking about the weather mode being lost, we could have a nearby phone and you can ring it, maybe we can have some kind of sense, which just kept them away.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 You can basically just go to the bus assistant between the two.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 So, you can press the button, which is always kept in one place and then it goes to the other bus.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 Wherever the map actually is. Yeah, we'd have to put two products together as well, which is, again, we'll do a bit of it.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 There's key rings, but you can whistle out a clap-back, I can't remember.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 And then the whistle back or something like that.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's not reasonable.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's not reasonable.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, I guess it's a little tough to say, or like the same technology could be put inside there.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you're trying to avoid having a second product because obviously you could have a second product that gave you the only pitch, which would be, which would set the remote off to say, here I am sort of like, you know, without sound recognition.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 But if you, I know, it's going to say a sharp noise, you know, a clapping of hand or whatever.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 You want to try and just have the one product that, if...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if we can have it in the actual amount, everything in one.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 Talk about, I mean, obviously, if you've got voice recognition, then you can do it in that way because it will recognize the voice and you can give it a command, a sick command, whatever that happened to be.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 But you can then go to the point, if you're not going with voice recognition then...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 You can have an option to turn it off or...

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, any suggestion?

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, any conclusions?

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 Would it take quite a while to sort of develop this feature recognition software in the remote control?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if it does, then we can't.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's that simple because we've got three primary requisites from a new meal that was sent to me.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Whereby we had the design logo was one, which we've already mentioned.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 We've got...

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 The remote was only for the television and not for...

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 Because that would make it too complex and we have to get out market quickly.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 And the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned has become outdated due to the popularity of the internet.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, that means that...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 So, these are the sort of three extra parameters that have been put on this project.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, anything that is to be added such as voice recognition, etc.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_00
 Has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is critical.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as we could get something in which was quite quick and simple, I would give us an advantage of it a little more.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 It would.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 But probably quick and simple is primarily rather than added extras.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Added extras would be nice.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 But the primary considerations to get the project finished within this short time window, which effect when now is four hours.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, and we've got to get to the end.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think first and foremost, we've got to get to the end and get to the end with some added extras if possible.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 One screw is this.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, then I'm coming.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, I need to...

0:26:26	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, I don't know how long we have left over time.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we're planning to proceed so that at the next meeting, each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 And also, when the next meeting is, I...

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 So, we'll know how long we've got to complete that task.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can report back at the next meeting and say, right, okay, yes, we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 This is how far we've progressed.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 Does that make reasonable sense?

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're going to be doing.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 And if between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting, if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time, you think would be relevant to other people in terms of their decision making process, then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting, do it via the email so that rather than coming, if you get the information just before the next meeting, that's fine.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_00
 Come along with the next meeting, we can discuss it then and take whatever actions appropriate.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 But if you get it well before the next meeting, let everybody else know, because that might have an impact on their...

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 What they come up with effectively at that next meeting.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, do we need to decide on the functions now?

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 I would guess so.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be really easy, if we did have some sort of whistle-bath kind of function.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 Because that also kind of the frustration of losing it.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was the number one frustration people said.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know about the voice recognition thing.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle-bath.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_00
 Something simple.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 The primary consideration is to get it there in time.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_00
 Time short, you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have it as a selling point for the product.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_00
 Something that's quick and simple.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 And that one would put off the kind of older generation either, because everyone would whistle a clap.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 And they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this retent

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 other than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got, if we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do. Something that, well, I don't know, if you think that more people can whistle than clap, then that's fine.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 They can go for that option.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 But if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle, so clap option.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 We've already decided that we don't need a teletext, but we haven't yet.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 Effectively, that's what they're saying.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 If people are now using the internet, then you don't need teletext.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 So take out teletext.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 Do we decide on having the 10 numbers and then the little good gen X to it, which kind of enables you to put into account?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a second or two to press another number.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you can press any two and it will sort of put them together.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 10 numbers and then some kind of device to allow a, yeah.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put delay to a multiple number.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 A multiple number.

0:30:35	None
 Yeah.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_02
 Do we decide on the other functions as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that?

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 You have an idea about the menu?

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 We could possibly put an out there, sort of the LCD menu in, but that again is probably an expense.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 But just thinking, um, people probably, I mean, you don't have to have a opportunity to use one, but you have to be able to tune it that one.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_02
 So in a family TV break, you're going to have to be able to tune it.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 You can't really avoid that.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 You decide the new dish the market is pushed to it by themselves.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 But that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic, and if it is at the moment, that's fine.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 But at the moment, it's not. So it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters, because otherwise it would make it your device would become, you know, probably or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market, which is.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 And it's also, it's the product we've got is something that's the, I would have said the lower end of the cost scale. So we're not really going for something that's.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 If people are buying remotes, then they're probably buying it to replace another remote.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 Possibly.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the tellies come with remote. So that's right.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 And we're maybe talking about the placing remotes for slightly older television. So we maybe need to keep the tuning functioning.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 So how does manual function with you? Maybe have like one menu button and you use the other buttons and then the other buttons to actually use other functions.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm going to use it.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because you do need a kind of brightness and contrast mode as well. My dad was watching the film the other week when it was too dark.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 So I had to go through it and tell the brightnesser.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to have the individual numbers and then the menu function and maybe sort of slightly more advanced instruction throughput.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 And with it, guys, I think it would be quite hard just for people to grasp just stuff like the menu that you get on different buttons.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to have some better instructions about how that actually works.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure whether sort of having people have a booklet because the second most annoying thing that people found was to learn the new one.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe next to each of the buttons, each of them could have a number and then also a function right next to it.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 So you're basically pressing.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 But that also goes back to the original design also those two and there was all in the left hand side which had a little double function instead which can look too busy and run a shot.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very good idea.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_00
 So you keep.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 We've got five minutes before we wind up those meeting.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I've been told I don't know if you've got the same.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00
 So so keep.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_00
 Keep detailed functions.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 Hidden at the back.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to have to work out what's going to be on these other functions as well.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to have like two set.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 Two set the list.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 You do two functions hidden at back.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 Can bring out when needed.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 The detailed ones will be sort of.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 So we're just so you've got which ones are going to be on the front which ones are going to be at the back.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 We have to decide.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 So on the.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_00
 So on the front.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 Numbers.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have a mute button as well?

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 A mute button as well.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 And probably power one as well.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not a totally nice.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Not in a shooting.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 But I'm not using standby.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 Like we have to have a similar address.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Like if you boil the kettle last four.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_00
 So are you having the standby on the front then?

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think you probably should.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have a channel up and down as well as a number of buttons.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah the market research said there was quite a lot of people to just zap around and flick.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got ten.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 Channel down.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 What else we got.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_01
 What was that six numbers is ten volume is.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 Volume but any volumes.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 One up one down.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_03
 Only.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's sixteen.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_02
 So anything else.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to put a button standby channel up and down.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 So is that it?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 That's sixteen buttons you reckon.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 And then at the back.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 You've got brightness and contrast.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we're going to run out of time one of the list of these and then get back and then like to make them just at the start.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 So on the back.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 You're also going to have the channel tuner in there as it were.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 Tuner would that have a button down?

0:37:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 So you go up and down and then it finds that there's only one of this way.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 Enter.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 Select.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we're keeping simple.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't mean any other options because it's just volume up.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_02
 I would have asked.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I think there's quite a lot of like doggies around, swedling, surveillance, sort of things.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_02
 So they have their own controls on their actual products.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 What do you have to do via the remote?

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as we got there they've got their own controls and we can avoid it.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh no, I mean, like this kind of individual.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_03
 Like on the TV.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know what I've never used them.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know there's something to do with.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe less.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 It comes up.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you might get some research on.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_00
 What should we look into that and then just get back to the.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll do the minutes of this meeting.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_00
 40 minutes, I believe is the time.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:35	None
 Okay.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Come on.

0:38:38	None
 Okay.
