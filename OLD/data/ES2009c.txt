0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, all right.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_03
 Let me just PowerPoint this up.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so this meeting will be about the conceptual design.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_03
 Don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's just something important that we need to do.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's kind of a turning the abstract into slightly more concrete, and this meeting ideally will come to some final decisions on what we're going to do for the prototype.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so apologies for the last meeting.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 It was brought to my attention that I did not make the rules clear enough, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 Fair enough. Thanks for the input. It's always good.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 So basically all we're going to do is have some presentations again, much like last time.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to go through you. Whoever wants to go first is fine by me, and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting, possible directions. And then we'll make some more decisions on basic, firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 Perfect. So without further ado, whoever wants to go first is free too.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 I'll go first. All right, Nathan. Take it away.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 It is Nathan. I'm not calling you the wrong name over.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_00
 No, Nathan's fine. Good.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's either Nathan or participant too.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 Mr. and participant too, that is.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 Nice. Okay. Nice.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 So basically what I'm going to have to talk to you about today is component design.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 And it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 So basically what I'm going to be doing is talking to you about that.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 Components of remote control. Okay. We've already kind of gone over this, but we're going to have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions sometimes soon. Energy source.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 Our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 Your standard battery, solar cells are manufactured in to anything about lithium.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 So we might have to look, if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 And also there's a kinetic energy possibility.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 Basically it's like a idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 So that's one possibility, but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen. So we'll have to look into that.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 The case, we have a few options.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic, rubber, or wood.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 And then as far as the way it's shaped, we can do standard-borne flat, which we probably don't want to do. Curved or very sexy, double-curved.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of thickness are we looking at?

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 I imagine that we could specify.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimeters.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons, there are multiple scope buttons available for a manufacturer, but to use those we would have to use more chips.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 And that would cost us more.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 And if we do go with rubber, double-curved case, we'll have to use rubber push buttons.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because the other buttons aren't compatible with that.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 And just a little note there, touch screen equals many chips, which equals many euro.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I noticed is that most remotes operate on the infrared part of the spectrum.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 So you notice when you push a button on the remote, you can't see anything coming out of it.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 But in fact, there is light coming out of the remote and the television conduct that.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 And if you were to record, if you were to make a video recording, you could actually see the light.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I thought might be interesting was to use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, it would have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 Is there an option that we could have that offer on so a person could select like...

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I am sure that we could do that.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, yeah, yeah, it's a good idea.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just as a fun gimmick.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_00
 Just to set us apart a little bit.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 And then onto the circuit board that we're going to use, also, notice the chip.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 We really don't have any way around the TA-11835.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 Findings. Okay.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 We're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 And my question to all of you is, should we look to other manufacturers, or just make two with what we have available?

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 Interesting question.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bit of a challenge question.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'd say shop around, but with our time constraints, is that really a feasible option?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Right. That's my concern too.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_00
 If we do go to the lithium battery route, then we'll have to go outside current manufacturing.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preference is, I'll just throw my cards on the table.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should probably go to the solar battery route, just to kind of keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 I like the idea that visible light signaling is something to set us apart.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 And I was thinking about...

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 So not so confined by one style and say, say, if we just go with one, and it doesn't go over well, then we're in a bad situation.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Can we do marketing piloting too?

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 Try to see what kind of before we launch. Can we see how they're received?

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's an option. Actually, I've got some research already on what we're looking at and trends in casing right now, which actually might even come into play beforehand.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, perfect.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm coming up with a side for now.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Great. Thank you very much.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's perfect. So I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 I guess so.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 Because I found some interesting things.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Fascinating.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 I wanted to hear.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_02
 So current market trends.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 Screen.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now, and what's going on in other design fields to see sort of what's trendy, what's new, what's happening.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control right now, basically, everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 They're sick of this boring, normal, functional, that we need innovative design options, and that needs to be an easy user interface.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 The challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology is a very organic, fruit and vegetable kind of thing.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colors, like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean, lined thing, maybe something we can look into, different skin options, or if we can't afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface, maybe having the images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be different.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, not the example I would choose, but you know what I mean to sort of, and apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 Not something I come up with a definite answer on, though, if we can get around to getting piloting, I thought maybe a casing option, like not like a skin, but like a holder almost, if you could do like,

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 leather options or wood options or something. I should have mentioned this, as far as the rubber that we can use, we can use a rubber as part of the case, it has a consistency of those stress balls.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 Might be an issue way to go. Yeah, so something to sit down for now. So overall, I think we should stick with what we're finding. Every's looking for easy use, technologically innovative and this fancy new, I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Interface. Oh, the interface graphics for the.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but then if the touch screen thing isn't going to work out for us, that's really not an issue.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 I like the idea of rubber at sea because it's tenset, be associated with being durable, something that you can drop and it doesn't matter.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 So many, you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote control.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 Very true.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's like with duct tape.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_00
 Very much so.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 You would have a problem.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 You could have a duct tape casing.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think that goes against the whole fancy something.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 But worth a shot.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 The granola crowd.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what I know.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_03
 Great. Thanks for that, Sarah.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 No problem.

0:10:01	None
 Run.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 Computer is adjusting.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 One moment, please.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, interface concept by your faithful user interface.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 So, user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or here.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 Or otherwise, perceive commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operating system.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 Here's a series of different remote controls that are out on the market today.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, the following are a bunch of different interface concepts.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 Voice recognition.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 We actually have some new information from our research design team.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 But I'll get to that in a moment.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, current voice recognition starts up to about 80 speech samples.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 And basically record your own verbal labels and connect them to the remote control.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Now, our design team, research team has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice recognition system to respond to with standard responses like you could say good morning remote control.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 And it will say in a sexy female voice.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Good morning, too.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, we already have this for our copy maker line.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of single people on the remote control.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Another concept is what Apple has come up with.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 The spinning wheel with LC display like on the iPods which I'm sure most of you know.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have this scroll button with the integrated push button.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 Like a modern loss of both of you.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 Crazy. I don't think that's what we're necessarily going for.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 And some special components.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Ideas like blocking having the ability to block channels from your children.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 And dedicated buttons for commonly used channels.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 And even ideas like secured or hidden programming.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 But again, if we go with touch screen, I don't think that's a big issue.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 And this is kind of the big daddy.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 The jumble universal remote control is almost impossible to miss place.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Again, probably not what we're going for.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 So I mean, my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 With a hard classic plastic casing, I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely very good ideas.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Changeable casings of our design team was possibly talking about including one extra faceplate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 And you can try changing and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Touch screen interface, possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 The important ones like power volume and jump between channels.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 And of course our voice commands system which I've talked a little bit about already.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 And the use of recognizable colors in shave state recognition of the features that are around.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 Red for power arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and whatnot.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 And perhaps you've been adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 For instance, my toasty maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Great and that is about it.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 Great wonderful run. Cool.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of good ideas, good facts to have.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's what they need is like a little dongle that just sticks up this furthest.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to stand up every time.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 So good to know all that stuff. Thanks guys.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 I know we kind of have to come to some decisions.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think, I don't know, what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point?

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 But can we really afford it because it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology, it's going to cost those upwards of 1750 euro.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty easy to watch.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's just an estimate that.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 You guys are always the dampers on these hands.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_01
 You're industrial designer.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 And our goal was to be under 1250 or we have to be under 1250.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I thought there was some flexibility with that.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 There is.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's just it is a question of.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 To justify it.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 And how much does that mean we're going to have to increase the price to make money.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 From 1250 if we want to get a 100% profit margin.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 That would mean selling it for 25.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 If you multiply 1750 by two, that's 35.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 Where do you guys come up with these numbers?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 There's just stuff in the head.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 It is pending for their emails.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 From the board.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Do I think that's what people would pay for.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if you're going to pay for an expensive high-class remote, you're going to expect to do something.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 I would be in a class of a term.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 And that's to be fair.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 The percent of the market, we're not going for mass, you know, mass sales anyway.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to make.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 We just couldn't not for 25 euros.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 We could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather than selling for 25, sell them for 30.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 But that's something we can have finance deal with.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 I say that we provision would go with the touchscreen.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_01
 What was your thought of the matter on?

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's a really good idea.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 And I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to go about this kind of production.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 My team on the third floor suggested that.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and we can look into this other manufacturing option.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you can get them somewhere else cheaper.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's true.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 We could initially go with what we have and if we can find the system.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Starting point anyway.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 We could have a very simple touchscreen.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 You know, there's always the opportunity that's going to be about the size of the iPod or whatever.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I guess we can play around with it.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say that.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 So the touchscreen will be our main selling point here.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think that we really have two main selling points.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think that our casing.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 And the voice record.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, really, this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 The voice rack thing.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if we're looking at bottom line.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're looking at opening the cost of 17 to get the touchscreen on.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think we might have to drop the voice rack.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'd have to decide between them.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 To be honest, we have the key.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 We have the design in house.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we've, we've come up with this, which is new voice.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 We're using it for coffee machines already.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 I can pass you on that email from my guy and guy down the hall.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds good.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think on anything about the voice rack?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think if we, we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 But it does put it into become the Rolls Royce of remote controls.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Pretty much.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 Very nice.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we have to reflect back on what our market research did say.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 And they said they won voice recognition.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touchscreen option.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 But definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 So to say we have the technology and we're not going to use it, even though we know it will sell.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 There's a call I don't think I can give the high-ups.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Like really, I can't go in and say no.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to stick nor everything we know.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Does having both really up our costs?

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 I can't see how it wouldn't.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, there's, you know, the old aphorism.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it fast.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it cheap.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it quality.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Pick two of three.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you can't have all three.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Because you, it's just a number of chips that you need to deal with each different function.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if we're going to pick it to, all right.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to pick between one of the two.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, yeah, we just, it just becomes cost prohibitive.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 What, which, which do we suspect we should hold on?

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 We should hold on to.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as, you know, viscerally solvent.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 But I, I, I personally would tend to the direction, but if that's what's going to sell, I think that's what we need to go with.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe we can table this touchscreen for our next model.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 I would have to side with that.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think the voice recognition is simpler.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 We have the, all the technology in house that's ready to go.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's packaged.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 What does the cost look like?

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's a cheaper to do the VR to do the touchscreen.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I, um, it's just off the top of my head.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 Keep in mind.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 But I think the voice recognition would, they're both it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 They're both going to push the cost up.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 But, um, since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition, we're not going to have to do as much design work.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 And sometimes the design work is what pushed the cost up.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:21:10	None
 If you know what I mean.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 I definitely have to agree with that last.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 And we're still not, then we don't have to deal with this battery issue really as much either.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 We can stick with what we've already got in a lot of other ways too.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm getting.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 So more or less, you guys think that of the two of them, the voice recognition will be better.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's our lower risk option, which right now we can have it on the market sooner, which is all in all our best option.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 Sorted.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 We will omit the touchscreen in favor of voice recognition.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 So, and when are we going to have basic prototypes coming up next?

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's you guys next step, right?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'm going to sort out what what what else we're going to talk about for the prototype.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, that's our next step.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to talk now about the materials we're going to use for the case.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 We'll just run through it.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 You discussed either a lithium or a solar power with the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition of this kinesthetic one.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control?

0:22:15	SPEAKER_00
 The solar power definitely would be, but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed because sometimes solar power fails just not around that.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_00
 We should install a small backup battery.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason the remote has some experts.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, people like to be in their basement.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 Like we're we can't guarantee someone everywhere.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 So having a factory source is probably.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 It works about the same as a solar powered calculator.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 And you know how those this don't really require that much light.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously a little more light than calculated, but we're not talking about a lot of light doesn't have to be out taking some bath.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think?

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to do agree with everything that's been said.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 I have to say though that another idea is coming up in my head.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent, we could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of a sweet little thing that sits on your table or something.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can you say?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 Why?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 Why moving away from handheld?

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 Why not?

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you don't need to pick it up, it could kind of be a selling point.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's got voice recognition.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 It can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think people that are people that buy remote, are they always going to want to use the voice recognition?

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's just something that they do sometimes.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 And probably I think we're banging on selling it to more than just voice recognition people like we want it to work fundamentally.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have to.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_03
 But that's done.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 They might have.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 Who is it?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the subwoofers, like clear and glass and the little pyramidal type of speakers.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Why not have a little rounded kind of thing?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 It could still have the basic buttons on it because we're going for basic functionality primarily as well.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's about, yeah.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe a menu button and so forth, you know, use the channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever, you know.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think you're onto something because we need to escape the traditional shape of the remote.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe something that looks nice on a table would be good, even though, and handheld at the same time.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's all about following Apple's week.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm thinking of the airport portal, you know, like that little pod looking thing.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, and I, although we do, as I'm recalling what she mentioned, we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brush to the aluminum thing and get back to it.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 But you could have a very tasteful wood colored or earth tone kind of.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 Terracotta bowl or something.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 Still, I mean, yeah, along those lines.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I like that.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 I like that idea a lot.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see what we can do as far as that goes. Okay. And the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 You know, I feel the tip on this pen is a bit gives just a bit.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, something where it's a more advanced form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Just kind of the squishy feel.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, which is the next big thing. So that's not going to hurt us either.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's see if we can do a squishy, non remote control looking remote control.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 But to be fair, yeah, I mean, you just could just put it literally put it on the night, the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_03
 I like it. I like that.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 And we've sort of discussed costs.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that's going to be a thing if we run a bit over budget, it might be okay.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry about the lack of information costs. I just haven't been provided information by manufacturers.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I have more ideas.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 We'll have more of an idea later on.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, go from there.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out. I think so we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a simple kind of function.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 You know, not too complex.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually like those shouldn't be.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_03
 Like maybe have menu things.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 If we're not going to touch screen root, then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 And then something that slides down into the field, you know, the more complicated things.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 We want to consider like an iPod screen, which isn't a touch screen, but you're still scrolling through menu options.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're hitting our cost issue.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 And we've also got the thing of we're going to have a non-remote looking remote.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 How do we?

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_03
 But no, I mean, we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it's say it's a little vaguely avoidable type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_03
 Or, you know, a series of, you know, three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side and up and down type of thing like on a DVD player.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 You see the modern DVD players will just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 And you can just kind of maneuver through the menu like that.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 So are we talking, we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to use scroll buttons, rubber buttons?

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it seems like, I don't know, it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber, because we're probably going to be using some kind of rubber for the outside case.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 Myles will stick with that.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think to a certain extent, we have to stick with kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then, and then make our unique future casing and whatnot.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 And our place.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, those basic, just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it are really versatile and every's already got them to some extent.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a moat there.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not like we're dealing with everybody re-learning things because it's not so many.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's been one of my new four.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 We've already kind of covered this as well.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 Seems to be selling.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 And we're more or less agree that we want to target this youth market.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 Especially now with 18 to 35 year olds being a large quantity of the population.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 Particularly in technological fields.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 So it's exactly where we're headed.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. All right. Well, more or less covered.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 But we need to cover, I think, in the final thoughts before we think about doing the product, moving out of the prototype.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what are we actually doing?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 I was just going to step on to.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it wasn't in the way.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it wasn't.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, my bad.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, we're not.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, I was just going to assign tasks in the next.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 Any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I would say that we are going to go with different style cases for different people.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 Or we just going to go with one.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's very, it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases that might open up the market a little bit.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, but you have just one case and it doesn't go over well.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a situation, but obviously having more cases also costs more.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then again, colors wouldn't be so hard to do.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 You could have a, you know, I am kind of a natural wood color, like a stained wood and, I don't know, all of green or something.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber, I don't think.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 And again, copying IMAX kind of for iPod Mac apples, color scheme.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, totally.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's probably good. Okay, so let's work on multiple case colors.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, stick with the same kind of, kind of.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so we'll have the next meeting in about half an hour.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 I want the, I'd like, Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 What can we accomplish given these parameters that we've sort of sorted out this kind of a non-remote remote.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 What are broad constraints before we design a prototype?

0:31:43	SPEAKER_03
 And, Ron, if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or on the side kind of menu options simple, somehow work out how we can get this all in the same place.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 And if you can check product evaluation with some pilots and stuff, I need you guys to work together on making a prototype using prototype building materials.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 So that's what to start with for now. Is that all right?

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's so clear about this.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we'll just hit the bricks. Thanks guys.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:32:34	None
 Thank you.
