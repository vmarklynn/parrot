0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think first.

0:00:01	None
 Okay.

0:00:02	None
 Who's going to do PowerPoint presentation?

0:00:03	None
 I think we are.

0:00:04	None
 You will as well.

0:00:05	None
 I thought we are.

0:00:06	None
 Yeah, I have one too.

0:00:07	None
 Okay.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 I thought we are.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I have one too.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_01
 I just want to, because basically I can't really crap it remembering everyone's names so I just want to rather than go out and miss marketing and miss this and miss that.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 I want to know your names again.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 I just can leave this up here because I'll, you know.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, Katherine, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and Gabriel.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 E-L-G-L.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and your-

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 I am Ryser, R-E-I-D-B-L-S-A.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 R-E-I-S-A-N. Double S-A.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, gosh.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a bit nicer calling people by their names, I think.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, right, welcome to meeting B.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 This is going to go a lot better than the last meeting, basically.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because I know what I'm supposed to be doing now.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 I am your project manager.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_01
 And, yeah, I'm just here to, you know, sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going, get people talking, and I'm going to be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff, basically.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 Right, this, for the purposes of this meeting, what this meeting is all about is I'm going to have some presentations from all three of you what you've been working on for the last wee while when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and, you know, filling out silly questionnaires and things.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive, so we're going to, each of you are going to give us a little presentation.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're going to work, you know, from each of your presentations, we'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll, yeah, we'll do a sort of concluding, anything else comes up at the end of it.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 How long is the meeting?

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 This meeting, it's not very long, it's probably down to about 35 minutes now.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five minutes, something like that.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 If you haven't done a PowerPoint thing, it doesn't matter, it's just says that you, that's just one particular medium.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 If you haven't had time to prepare one, you can draw stuff on the note board, you can talk to us, you can, you know, however you want to do your presentation, basically, you can don't feel pressurized into using this thing, because I don't.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so, you're okay over there?

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm fine, yeah. Are you joining in with this meeting?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to do your first presentation.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 You're just doing some internet shopping there.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no, I'm done.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, jolly good.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 All right, let's have, well, we all know that it's a remote control that we're going to be dealing with.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think the first thing we should look at is probably the, what it is that it's actually supposed to be, so that's going to be UCath, right?

0:04:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to hear from you first.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, just going to do this.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 You've done that to worry about screwing it in just.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 I've got a very quick.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 So the working design, I've got a very quick presentation on this.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, I've, oh no, you can't see a thing.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, well, I'm going to join on the board then.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's in blue and I couldn't change it.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine on my screen, but nevermind.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, the idea is that we've got the energy source, which in our case, oh, well, okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 Nevermind.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think maybe two batteries.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what they call a lot six or something like that.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_02
 And then, then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal, which could be an infrared signal.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 Which will be sent by an electronic chip.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip will be controlled by the user interface.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, we'll hear about that later from Gabriel.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 And the sender will send to the tele itself an infrared signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 And that's it really for the working design.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, the presentation wasn't very okay.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 I prefer to put up further here than touch personally.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 Should I erase this?

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to just give us a moment?

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 I just want to copy this down.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_02
 Suggestions.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 Is a battery like the only way of?

0:08:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's just you don't want it plugged in really.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, alternate energy source like wind power.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 You blow on it.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 No, because like, charge is always changing.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Batteries can get like annoying the battery down and maybe.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's worked for the last 50 years.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 One question I have and I don't know how much control we have over this is as far as the infrared signal.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have control over how far away you can be from the receiving unit that the TV and still have it be operational?

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we want one with a strong signal straight.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 How far away is your television?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's never going to be more than it's never going to be.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Unless you've got a TV the size of a football pitch.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's not doesn't have to go that far, does it?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't have to go through a wall because you're not going to be looking through a wall.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you tell the television office and think you really want to go into the telephone down the garden.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 But we can make the signal strong enough to go through walls if she finds it.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 I do not think about that.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 How about blue tea?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of using infrared.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:09:28	SPEAKER_02
 I just think that it's going to cost more.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it sounds like we don't want to overcomplicate things.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's a fancy idea. It's quite nice.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 But then I don't know.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 Either if you want to watch the teller you're in the room, you're going to...

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Basically we're designing and marketing television remote control unit.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 We're not designing something that you can plug in a headset to and connect to your laptop computer and stuff.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 We can keep the idea.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 We can see the later stage maybe.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:13	None
 Well done.

0:10:20	None
 Go for real.

0:10:24	None
 Let's hear from you on...

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Do you need the board or six?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to use the power case.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 Technical struggles.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 So while this is warming up, there it is.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm doing the user interface design.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 And basically, as far as methods, I was looking at...

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 Looking at already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 Thinking of what we can retain, what we can do away with, what we can perfect a little bit as far as design.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want to do something that's too radical of a change, I guess.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 People want a remote that's familiar, that has their favorite functionalities and does the basics.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 So we can improve what's out there and maintain the basic functionality that we want.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 So things that seem like absolute must-haves would be volume control to up-down keys for that.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 Channel keys up-down, but then also numerical keypad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want rather than doing up-down.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 And a mute button.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I didn't include here that I forgot that we talked about last time was doing some sort of block function.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. I don't know. That's one possibility.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 And so in the research that I was doing, there's basically two types of remotes, one that are engineering-centered and one that are more user-centered.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, I don't know if I can access the web page from here.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 I can show you.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 So this is an engineer-centered one. See, it's rather busy, but it also lets you play your movie, stop your movie, fast forward, all this.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's a breeze frame, and this is a user-centered one.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's easier to just glance at this and see what's possible to do. You're not going to be staring at it for five minutes.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 All right. Judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting, I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, or the direction that we were going in at least.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the engineering-centered ones provide a lot of functionality, but it can be a little bit overwhelming.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 So the user-centered ones just focus on ease of use.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 And it sort of overlaps with the marketing person, Lisa, because we need to find out what people want before we make the same assignments.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're all good.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, that's me.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Great. Okay.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Now, I just have a question for you.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 This research that you've been doing, looking at other existing units and stuff.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 Have you found that anyone else just looked into the locking?

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 That seemed like a novel idea as far as I know.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, obviously another that exists, like you said, in mobile phones.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 I've never seen that in all my years in business.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Do you guys have a yay or a yay on that feeling about whether that's really necessary?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 I would say if it's simple to do, which I think it probably should be, even if it's a physical, you know, like a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Then, yeah, it's like, you know, like you said earlier on a flip thing, something like that, but you know, being physical.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Look into.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centered at.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, something we should take into account is we've got to keep the corporate image within this remote control unit.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to look like it's in the R&R.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 You know, the company is it's from what I can see from our other products, a yellow with blue writing on them.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 And our motto is we put the fashion in electronics.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 There you go.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to carry that mental.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 So it's kind of got to look, it's got to look new and, you know, something fashionable if remote control.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if telephones can be fashionable, then maybe remote control units can be.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, these I think we can.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 So we talked about the layout in my presentation, or why I didn't mention it really is just the sort of like the ergonomic.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_00
 Everything is going to ergonomic.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_00
 You know, there's, you know, nice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches sort of in the market, I guess.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, fantastic.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well done Gabrielle.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Lisa.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Let's plug you in, baby.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Here.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 The blue thing.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 All right, Alice is getting a little tangled.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's the answer.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 Is that in?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, then you just have to do function, effort, and it should come up.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, function, effort.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it is.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's really well.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, from our marketing report, we observed remote control users in the usability lab.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 And also gave, so this is research, and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 Total number of people tested were 100, so, you know, so that 100 people were tested.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_03
 And these were the findings.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 So 75% of users find the remote control ugly.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so they don't like the look of the remote control.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 80% of them would spend more money if the remote control looked really cool and fancy.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 I think we all agree with that.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 So they don't like the way they operate.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't match how people behave.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_03
 And 30% of the users say that they only 10% of the buttons on the remote.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 So probably if you have like one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to 10, they probably don't use those.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 They only use up and down channels.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 Because we've only got five channels.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's another thing.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 75% of users say they zap.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 Not quite sure what they mean, zap.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 So you want to navigate the channels quickly?

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote, I think, especially for the older generation.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 It takes ages to work out.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, and they also get lost in the room.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 So I know we can find them.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe tracking devices is a good idea.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 Personal.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 Wow.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 You are a child of technology, aren't you?

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's to look really cool, flash and groovy people to buy it.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 And it's easy to find.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't know whether maybe.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 And also we asked them whether they wanted, whether they'd be interested in voice activating.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 So voice activation.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, and this was what we came up with.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 And if you look 15 to 25, this is age.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's out of the way.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Age groups.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 So 15 to 25 said like 92, 91% of them.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 So basically the majority, except for the 45.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_03
 55 year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation, who we are catering for, like who have lost the money nowadays, do want a voice like speech recognition.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 But do the younger generation have the money?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 No, I would absolutely not.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 They don't.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's older generation of the ones that have gone out.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the 25 to 35 year olds, 35 and the 35 to 45, 45.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 45.7%.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 People from the age of 30, there's a big drop off there.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 For people up to the age of 35, they're kind of saying, yeah, they want it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 But no, they're not the sort of, most people that have the money, people from the age of 35 to 55.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would be my guess.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Because they're the ones that have been working for 20 years.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 And that's quite a minority there.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, it's not even like 50, 50.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's 35%.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 These guys are growing up.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 What about just from the perspective of our manufacturing cost?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if it's 1250 per unit.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, okay, there's voice activation might not be the best.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 I would say scrap that straight off.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 Also with buttons, I think called RSI.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, repetitive strain injury.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, repetitive strain injury.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think people who watch TV maybe too often keep changing the channel and hurt their wrist.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's something we should have a look into.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 When designing the ergonomics to see, have a look if there's any medical background we can find out about this.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 But then it could be just touching.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 We just want to need to cover our asses so that people aren't going to sue us in 10 years time.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 We should probably consult with our legal department.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 They're having an lunch break at the moment.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see if I can get elders for next meeting.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can do some really in that department, the ergonomic department.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 It makes some really good improvements.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much really just like flat buttons.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:48	None
 Okay.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, that is me.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's great.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you very much for that, Risa.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've basically.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 We've decided that it's going to, you know, we're going for basic television remote.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to be safe to use.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to look cool.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to be cheap.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 Now, going back to the industrial design event, you know, we're looking at whether to use the technology.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 We're looking at whether to use maybe infrared or Bluetooth.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should just go with the simplest option on everything.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 And that would be infrared energy source and batteries.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 When we can look into using the, you know, the little tiny, we need batteries or special long lasting batteries.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 But in this note, I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's going to last for 50 years because technology would have changed and, you know, we won't have televisions in 10 years time.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think we're all pretty sussed on that.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Anyone have any questions?

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody happy in their work?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 It seems like we're all pretty much on the same page.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're pretty now.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 This is good.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 We've got a good structure going on.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 We all know where we're going to.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Have you been, have any of you not been getting loads of crap spam on your computers?

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's probably just you because you're the project manager.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 Just question.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just stuff.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, did you guys find out if we can email stuff to each other?

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 You all know my email address.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 In this project announcement, you've got the addresses, I think.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 So project manager, it's a one at a.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 Can you all email me your email addresses?

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 You have the message.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 You have them.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 But we'll send you an email.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, we headed towards a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue?

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, but I might be just kind of like white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's getting ahead of ourselves.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm up with a few with a couple of different ideas.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_03
 Can we have different colors and all of us are somebody can choose different colors?

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, see, the thing is, is we've got to keep the company image.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to say people have got to look at this remote control and instantly recognize that it's a real reaction.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 But if it's R, R, it would be real reaction.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 Like if that's a lot of companies that called R.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 They just slow, but this is the slogan. This is the, the, the, the, the.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 In a something that came on down from, from the higher.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we're sort of beholden to them.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to have it one color.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, not necessarily.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 Not one color, but we have to incorporate it.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Not necessarily even.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's just has to, you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 As opposed to a Sony product or, you know, a Panasonic product.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's got to.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe so you can have a look at our other products and see if they all follow us.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Similar vein.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 But it could come in different colors and have the R, R colors just somewhere.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Like just around the lock button could be the R logo or colors.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is all your department.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well done, everybody.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 And I think we stop for lunch now.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are we finished ahead of schedule?

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 We might possibly have done.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 See you soon.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 If we've finished five minutes before the meeting is supposed to finish then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch.

0:27:29	None
 Yeah.

0:27:30	None
 There you go.

0:27:31	None
 All right.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_03
 I just have to do a few little bits pieces.

0:27:34	None
 I have to write down, but.

0:27:37	None
 Take your head sets off.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 Kick back.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 Smoke them.

0:27:41	None
 If you got a little bit of a kickback smoke them.

0:27:31	None
 Yeah.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:27:34	None
 All right.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 I just have to do a few little bits pieces.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 Smoke them.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 If you got them.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right.
