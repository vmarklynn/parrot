0:00:30	SPEAKER_05
 Kay.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_04
 You're late.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_05
 Zoom.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, all set.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome to the conceptual design meeting.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 The agenda. The opening, I'll again be the secretary in make minutes, take minutes, and it will be three presentations, just like the last meeting. So, who wants to start off?

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 Technical designer again. Okay.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 Before we begin, I want to say I put minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder, but they're still not quite okay. It's still some technical difficulties, so the first part of the minutes are very hard to read because there are two documents that are layered over each other. Okay.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 But from now on, I won't use my pen anymore.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's just ordinary keyboard. It's better.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_01
 Keyboard work. I think it will be more easy for you to read minutes.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 All right. Okay. When we talk about components design, it's really about material and really the stuff we build the remote controls of.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control consists of components and the components of a re-riled control consists of properties and material. We have to choose these wisely and it could affect a kind of growth in buying the remote controls.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 The components of remote control are of course the case.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 The properties of the case are it has to be solid, a hard material like hard plastic with software for falling and it feels good in your hand.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons has to be solid too and the material is software.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 I've got an email from the possibilities of real reaction.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_02
 They are telling me that when we build a remote control of plastic or rubber, the buttons have to be rubber too.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. When we use a rubber-doubled curved case, we must use rubber push buttons too. The rubber-doubled curved case is a three-dimensional curve in the design, which is necessary and we want to be trendy.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 The energy source, I've got a lot of possibilities for that too.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 The basic battery, which I prefer because of its non-dependent of here.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_02
 You have to have a kinetic energy also in this one, like in the watches, remote control can lie on the table for a day and then you push a button so you don't have to work with it all the time.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 Solar shells are also a bit weird for remote controls.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 Also the case material, I think plastic is the best with rubber because wood or titanium would also be a bit weird.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 How about taneums? Probably trendy, I think?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's true, I guess.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe a little bit expensive.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how they don't tell anything about the cost of titanium.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 The chip set and the board is all of the shelves.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 Also the speaker in the remote control when we want to retrieve it.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 The base station is also of the shelf. All the materials and components are just available in our factory.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 I've told about the three first points.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 The simple electronical chip is available with the lead transmitter.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's all of the shelves and even the speaker and the wireless retrievers are all available in our company.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 Another possibility I looked upon was the LCD displays.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 Could be something special to our remote control.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible, but it only costs a bit more.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it can be within the limits of 25 euros.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 12.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I've got an email with some examples.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 This is where the most trendy is one.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 You see a coffers which can be...

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are those the tooth brushes?

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 It resembles the design.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can bring a couple of...

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 A couple of types of...

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 A whole set of different remote controls.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can bring a whole line with a huge variety of houses.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 Like maybe radios and television also in the same style.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_04
 That'll be for the future, I guess.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, because we have to bring the logo and all the stuff back into it.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, sir.

0:09:03	None
 I'll look it up.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay.

0:09:08	None
 I'll go to the next slide.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 I still don't have any information about user requirements.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking about just the basic functions.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 We decided on that in the last meeting.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 But then when there are new user requirements.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't receive any new requirements.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 No, but we decided to use only basic functions.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if there are maybe a little bit more.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can think of that later.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 These are the ones you already summed up.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 I pointed them out here.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 Just to make that a little bit easier.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 Another function is, of course, we already discussed it on the side.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what costs of it.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 I was also looking for what you said for I got a name about LCD in front of the remote control.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that's a good idea or maybe it's a little bit too much for 12.5.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_03
 If we got already something like a base.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 Bit redundant also maybe.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what kind of information.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 I was just thinking about it and I got a problem.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can bring a tail text to the remote control.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 They've got to have like a little bit more.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Make RC a little bit too big.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the functions are not more to discuss.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the base things we already discussed at the No PCR.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 That's very easy.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 But you do mention the next and previous button.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's next channel.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_03
 I got an email with a remote control with a base.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's just an idea.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 I think of the button sizes and I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think it depends on the function.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm the expert for user friendly but not for trendiness.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 If you save tiny buttons aren't user friendly then we wouldn't implement that.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, okay.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit of a point.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've nothing to do.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 When we only use base functions we have the possibility to make the buttons larger.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit larger.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think we already agreed upon the fact that the skip buttons and volume buttons, those two, they have to be large.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the two basic buttons, skip channels.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know why but I think that's the trend.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 It puts an extra accent on the simplicity of our remote to make these two most basic functions extra big.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 I also probably use the most used buttons on the unit.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's from your research.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 That was all personal preference I didn't have.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Anytime left.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 You don't care.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 Go away.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 Come on.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, click on it.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, great.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 I've done some research again about trends on the internet.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 I've done some investigation and I got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and Milan.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 Some finding the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the most control.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 We were going to imply that.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 That's nice.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 The second important thing is innovative technology in the RC.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_04
 Our market really likes that and the third point there in this order of importance, the third point is a high ease of use.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_04
 For the idea, I've put some trends for the markets for elderly people, dark colors, simple recognizable shapes.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_04
 So we probably won't do that.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_04
 The younger markets like the themes of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_04
 I found this image which is, well, it symbolizes the idea of fruits and vegetables.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_04
 I don't see the spongy part in it but with a little bit of fancy.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have to do something with spongebob.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 I got some ideas.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, pictures isn't really a good word but some symbols of fruits or vegetables may be.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 Catch your colors.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Fruit is yellow, green, red, whatever.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 So remote controls in catch colors.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, we don't want dark colors.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_04
 No, I just put them there for general.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 For general idea.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_04
 The darkings, I think, spongey material is very irritating for the remote control itself.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 But to implement some spongey thing, maybe we can do it in the darking station at the bottom of the darking station or whatever.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 And we could bring one line with the dark color to...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 For diversity.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_04
 Also, a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and wonder.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe want a little younger design but still the dark color.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it reaches a different market but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring like a black RC on the market or whatever.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 How do we use fruit and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control?

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 I think that our design already resembles some piece of fruit like a pear.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 There's always empty space of course on remote control.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think this part of the RC, well...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think you have to do it the upper part or whatever.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 It's not used with buttons, I guess.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_04
 So you can put some fruit in.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to remind you explicitly of a piece of fruit but just the round curves.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think this already resembles something like a pear to me.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, exactly.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 If you make a little bit of greenish.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 Do you get the idea? The fruit is kind of round.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, we could use one of these for the... What is it?

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 I don't even need to create an artist or something like that to make it work.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 Vegetable or fruit?

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 We have a very big team.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_04
 We can do multiple things.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 This is then the pear.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know the English word.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's pear, yes.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe we don't have bananas.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 Not easy for remote control, but we can't make all 10 designs.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 We have to make one design, I think.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 But I think it's already two or three.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 What we were up to.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to resemble what I already said a specific piece of fruit.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 No, sure.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 But just like a fruity thing going on.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 But that's great.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what I was saying.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 But I do like to catch the colors.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I do like to do the idea of making a catchy color design.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think a dark color would be nice too.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_00
 Picked is a fruit.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's too much.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 We have to.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 Not very simple.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 There have to be the firm colors.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Our own color.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 We've got our...

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 A real reaction.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 She can put a logo on top of it.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't think our company colors are this fashionable.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can...

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 If we've got a docking station over here, I can draw with this thing, but I'll try.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_04
 If this is our docking station, we can make our logo over here.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't work.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then...

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, in the button then.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 With the strawberry on top.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, in the bottom of the remote.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 The button over here.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 Whatever.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 On the front, of course.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 Because else you can find it.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 So that will my this a little bit.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_04
 I'll close them down.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_04
 Go away.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, can you open the conceptual design?

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 On the presentation.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 See what was on the agenda?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 Lazy.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 The agenda.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 The decisions on the remote.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because maybe we can start with the technical functions, but I don't think...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want to use an LCD display, for example?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's nice.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 Of course.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know what to display on it.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can make a TV guide on it for the channel you're on.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it should be like this big.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think we should do it.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 The TV channel with four programs, you can zap to them with the page down button.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, sure, but it has to show an entire title of a program, or at least a quite large part of it.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 And then you get a very large LCD.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, when you're mobile phone, you can you can read text also.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 So why not on your remote?

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 Never.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a bit redundant.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 And it's also not... I don't even think it looks like sexy or something.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_03
 What would you display on it?

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 A program information or a guide on TV.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of new TVs.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, also on the internet.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
 A lot of TVs in each show when you...

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 Which already works in your TV.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 You're not going to watch your remote control.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but you also want to know what's next.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 But then we also need to bring out a line of TVs, which we're planning to do, or whatever.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 Because the TV has to send information back to the RC.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't know if that's possible.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 That's really possible.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, yes, of course it's possible.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 But you've got to implement it in the TVs.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't think everyone's going to buy a real reaction TV within a month after the release of our remote control.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I really understand you want to make your job more exciting than anything else to be in it.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 But I really don't think it's a good... because it also doesn't stroke.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 We wanted... when we talk about the materials, it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with the soft rubber stuff on it.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 It was our idea to give it a more sturdy look.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 And you can throw with it.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think LCD display fits in that image.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's more vulnerable.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's not very solid.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_04
 You can make it.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's coherent with the design we're after.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 In my opinion, we can vote for it.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD display.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't want to.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 And he doesn't, so it's up to him.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 If you...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of fatal...

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
...right?

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I can also say...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 We can fold your way.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can do...

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 So what do you think this is?

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 We're not even sure what information we want to display.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 No, that's right.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 And I also have to think about new functions, maybe buttons or something like that, to control that LCD or something?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I guess.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 You can use buttons that are already on the remote control.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 For double function.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 When I go to the second channel, what does it show me?

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 The title and information about the program.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 About that program.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 But what he said was right about the televisions.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 They have to be customized to that.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 No, that's not going to work.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe in future it will be a giant hit and when you are the first.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 You have the biggest...

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Like the bigger universal remotes, the LCD displays.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 But then it's very functional to indicate what device you are controlling.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I've seen.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 You can put a little LCD display on it with lots of information.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 But it just doesn't match with our whole basic concept.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 But when you put a transparent plastic screen on top of it, it isn't vulnerable.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_01
 No, that's maybe not the most important.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 Is it fashion?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 When you put maybe a color LCD screen on it, it's very special and very trendy.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 A remotes control.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's a rocket if it's trendy.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 What do you have?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 You have to do it after the trendiness of LCD display.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's always pretty trendy to be honest.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know if I'm coming back to the cast again.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 But I think we've got to build a pretty cheap design to stay within our limits.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 And I think especially color LCD, which is pretty trendy.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 I think it will be too expensive.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 But I've got the email with the possibility.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 And LCD was a possibility for the control.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 So why don't we use it?

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have it.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to have it.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 Also for monogramme LCD or colored LCD.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to be trendy, you have to be colored.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, really.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_04
 If you have black and white or something or gray, in 2004, you can't put something on the market, which is monogramme.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_04
 Really?

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, but it doesn't say anything about the color.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 But I also got the possibility to put a scroll button on it.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't really know the whole idea of LCD display.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 You can't convince me.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just read you guys.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't really feel it.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 We already were...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's too much maybe.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 We actually have the base station gadget.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 And it has to be a simple design which...

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, but we've got a point about a little force.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 And I think not a whole package of specialty.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 And really, I don't see how the LCD display is going to add anything on a design level.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's...

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 No, wait.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Slicker to have no LCD.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 But at simplicity, you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but with these two buttons, you don't need an LCD.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 That remote controls are already on the market.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but when you want to have something special.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 We already have the docking station which is...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but we have a picture of it from another company.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be the fellas.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, but it does...

0:26:47	SPEAKER_01
 It does.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 It does.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 It does.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_00
 It does.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 It does.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's already made.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 The remote controls.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to develop our own docking station.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Is that something?

0:26:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 The big two are the prototype?

0:26:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 I've never seen it in the store.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 But we really have to cut this off.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 I guess the idea you really like it, you know, the LCD thing, but I think it's not a good idea.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 We have already mentioned all arguments.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 Do you guys think...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's too much.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a little too much, yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's overdone.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we...

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 Let's skip the LCD.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry, maybe you can do something for your own place or make...

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 Make it happen in your basement or something.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 I will rule the world with it.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but for the technical part, the material, I think it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, maybe a bit of cushioning.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 This is what the...

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 The sponge, yeah.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it feels so ready.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 We're after, you know, to give it the soft touch in your hands and also the...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 No, like, yeah, this is the airbag kind of thing.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, you're just gonna drop it.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 Throw it at your wheel, brother's head.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 If you drop it, the airbag comes out.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe...

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 But then we have to look that it will not be too childish to see.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's a good point.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 And that's why I like the dark color bit, you know?

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 Because maybe the design...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's a bit of...

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 But not black, I think.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit 90s, maybe, what we're up to right from to this point.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 If it's fruit and vegetables, it has to be colorful.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_01
 But it has to be a little bit solid.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 It mustn't be too overwhelming when you put it in.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 Can we combine it or something with yellow and black?

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe so.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 Make it a B?

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 What?

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 B.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, a B.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't like to get on that combination.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 But it is our company colors.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's real good colors.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have to use yellow.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't like yellow.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we can ask...

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 But that's not really pretty.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 Really nicely out there.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 We can put the logo on our base station.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe very, very tiny on the remote control itself.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but what are other technical things we have to discuss?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 Front of the...

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 We can have different fronts of the...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 Should we do that?

0:29:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think you should do that.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe just bring it out in different colors, but not off the key.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 I get that.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_01
 Fronts afterwards.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's also too much.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 People don't want to spend more money on their remote control.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 You can design...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Use the customer with color you want.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_04
 Just bring more design to your market.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 For color.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Without...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, are we through the technical part then?

0:30:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we agreed upon...

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, not...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 This is our real young and dynamic style.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 The materials you mentioned in your personal preferences were quite okay.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's not only the last point.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's not titanium.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_01
 No titanium is not an out of question.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's just like this titanium.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 But when we use both the plastic and soft things and titanium as well.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_02
 Makes it in a homogenous design.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 But then you can throw with it.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 It will make a huge noise or break other stuff.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 When you throw with it, you will break other stuff with your remote control.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium is a bit...

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 No, but you should be harder.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 But also on the colors.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, think of the possibilities to make it completely titanium.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 What would it be more trendy, more chic?

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think that...

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think that the titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but the titanium remote control.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 When you're watching TV or your hands are a little bit sweaty.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_04
 On the other hand, if you want to make frozen stuff with it.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 I really like the idea of the plastic and the big kind of thing.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because then it fits in our philosophy to make it sturdy and simple.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like sports and gaming.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 When you make titanium, it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 And when it's big and plastic, it's like some fun stuff you can always have around.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's always fun to have something big and plastic around.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's a empty tree player of Nike.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 So isn't that titanium with a little bit rubber?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it's...

0:31:55	SPEAKER_02
 But it is plastic.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_03
 Is it plastic?

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's titanium looking.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, what we can do that only.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yes, yes.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you know the empty tree player of Nike.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's very...

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's rubber.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 We can make this a style too.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe this is difficult.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's different material.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 And then you're going to have two material lines.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we can make it from the same kind of plastic.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_04
 If it's just a color, which you change, then I guess it's nice to have one of these.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_01
 I do like the idea of maybe a titanium type of body and then with plastic coloration.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 You don't like the soft stuff, but I don't know if it's possible.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have the information.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't cut it.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 But you can make the plastic that titanium look.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, true.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_01
 But make it just like shine.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, true.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that's a good idea.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 But if you want to lay it longer, then two weeks from the end, you can maybe...

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should talk about our months.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what time?

0:33:09	SPEAKER_02
 40 minutes.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 In a lot of other product categories, like even in bags industry, they began with typical leather bags, but then they became stylish with all sort of colors.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of fun of fronts.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 Like we can use on the telephone.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 Like Eastpac began a revolution with all these kind of bags and colors.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_02
 And different colors.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, and styles.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 They have also kind of roses on it.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a possibility.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 But let's think about the base.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 Then we can always use the same design for greater resemblance, but with new colors, new prints, on this.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 But our basic idea, I mean, you're probably going to have like two type of materials, like the plastic enclosure and then the pets that surround it and in light.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 We have to incorporate the lights too.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Are we going to give it a two tone color look like the plastic mold is in one color and the caution pets around it are in another color.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the idea?

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 Is that a good idea?

0:34:35	SPEAKER_04
 How do you mean the rubber?

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 How many colors are we going to have?

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 We're only five minutes left by the way.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 How many colors are we going to give it?

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Like two tone color?

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 There are three components.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 Three components type.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 You have the buttons.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 The case.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe the case of rubber should be in one color and then the rubber of the buttons and the cushions as well should be in another color.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Or you just make one color maybe with a kind of like a big wave or something like.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but not more than another color.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 Not more than two colors.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 No, definitely not.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we should talk about it.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 Or when you use the buttons as black, you can use two colors as well.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do we have to think of some other important things?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 The functionalities or the devices?

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking about the, do we still want the joystick idea?

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think that's too vulnerable.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is okay.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we have basic, we have the numbers, we have the power button, we have a data text.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe one to access a menu or something.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's how I was thinking that's got to be on the television.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I think I really need a menu button.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the only button.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of menu?

0:35:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I...

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 Is it a different from every television?

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, I think most TVs have an...

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a different...

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 A menu nowadays to access the screen settings.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's okay to add a menu button for...

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 But that covers all the...

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 All the other settings, it covers everything then.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_02
 But then you have to put up and down and left and right.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_04
 You can use the two, eight, four and six.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 And you can also use the normal skip buttons for that.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 In that way, we have only the numbers, the power button, skip and volume.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 And then a remote.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then a text.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 And a menu.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then a menu.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we need...

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 Another style of some stuff.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 About the design of the docking station, something important about it.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 We should remind us of the remote itself, I guess.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, definitely.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_04
 In one corner.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_04
 Are we gonna do something with the spongy thing there?

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 I think the spongy thing already comes in the cushions, bats and things on the side.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 We will make it spongy.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 And the fruity thing is just the shape should be fruity.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is kind of fruity.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 You know, just round shapes with...

0:37:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's kind of fruity.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_04
 Catchy colors.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we really have to think...

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think colors is very important because it has to be fleshy.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 But it doesn't have to be annoying that when you have...

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know, some things just over the top.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_01
 And when you have the table for more than two weeks, it just gets annoying because it's so big and fleshy.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be some level of subtlety.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 But we still have to think of how we managed to get to that.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 I guess so.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 But I think also we just show we have to do something with color.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 But also I think we have to keep the dark color thing in mind.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think that adds to the too much color maybe.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 Too much color.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_03
 When you got it in the living room, it's much maybe...

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 But aren't it designed experts?

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be.
