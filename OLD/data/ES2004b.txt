0:00:00	None
 How?

0:00:02	None
 Maybe.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is that clear?

0:00:09	SPEAKER_01
 Huh.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's green flat.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_03
 No, not really too hard.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, my God.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'll go over what was decided on universal control.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 One hand set for all TV videos.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 That it was important that the product that built a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limited in one.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's very important to affect the company's image and our product, the profession, and electronics, and that kind of thing.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 Our budget would have to affect, try not to reflect our budget that we might have a bit of...

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you can do it.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_01
 The dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_01
 We discussed the flip-o from design, reducing the size of control and an electronic panel.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 The further features that we're programming, things like that.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 Three presentations I've got written here, so...

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
...surely here for my team, though.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 Is it okay if I postpone that to later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 Is that okay?

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, okay, first. Can I grab the...

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
...like me?

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so, I think...

0:03:13	SPEAKER_01
...and F.A.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
...butching.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is the working design presented by me, the industrial design extraordinaire.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so...

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the first thing question asked was, what are we trying to design?

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change it, and just say whether that be the power or the channel, or the volume, everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances, sending a signal to.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, I decided that I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 And I thought that was something that, well, it wasn't really in my area because I'm dealing with the inside, really.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last time.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_03
 And I found out that most controls use some form of infrared sent signals to the TV, presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that can be used wireless, and you don't need to send very much information.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 Most of them are powered by some form of battery.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 Now, R1, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue, because most of them are powered by AAA batteries, but those can be quite bulky.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else, so we could shrink down the size of the control.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Can I interject to ask the question?

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 Is that appropriate?

0:05:23	SPEAKER_02
 You're saying the AAA batteries are small or the current?

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, if you look at most remote controls, they're quite chunky, and that's because of the size of the batteries.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_03
 They have to be, obviously, this certain size to fit those batteries.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 The AAA's are the smallest you can get.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, you can get the sort of circular round ones, but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the battery across, which leads on to the next point about being small and easy to carry around.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the ones at the moment are small, but I was just wondering if we can look at something a bit smaller.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries, because otherwise it's not going to work.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_03
 As I said about the which batteries we're going to choose, we can discuss that later, and then obviously you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal, which we're going to use to send the information.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 Now, these have a wireless range up to about five meters, which is so suitable for anyone who's watching their TV unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do say as we're applying for the most audience, that should be fine, and then I was just had a quick look at the external design, but I left that mostly to the interface designer.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we want to do.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a proper circuit.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure if it works or not.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not even confident that those are the real way you'd wire it up.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 But anyway, we've just got the power going to the infrared bowl with the chip and the UI interface.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 Which would basically, when you pressed anything, the chip would convert it into some form of IR data, which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 And since that's another reason to use infrared, because that's what all TVs are doing.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 And then finally, we want it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 So all the components that I've put forward are low-end costs, so that should be good.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 It should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 We were talking about it before, and also just something that I was thinking about.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because they're small, they're also easy to lose.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 So if we could look into some way of, I don't know, some anti-going down the side of the sofa.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 The thing that you could have, that was just sort of a general point there.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's a very important point. It came up in our market research findings too, so I can refer to that.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 I really like my tip, isn't it?

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's what I came up with there.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Would you like to continue more from there?

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's completely different.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's completely different.

0:09:25	None
 It's completely different.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's okay. I feel right.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good function.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a good function.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good function.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, some of my points might overlap with what William just mentioned.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 But basically, my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last movie, just took up valuable points and started developing on that.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 There might be some missing loops in this thing, which I think will take a feedback from the marketing.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because I haven't had some marketing data, and basically every product is market driven.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV, to make it as simple as possible.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 And to summarize, I would say it should be user friendly by being easy to use, rather than having a lot of complex buttons, because you can have an engineering driven, maybe having 100 buttons, and maybe having a remote control, which has the main features, like volume control or channel changing the channel or whatever.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 But we have to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will punch in these two features together.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 So what the concept is to have a flip top model, the main functions such as which are often used will be on the top, and the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or trendy generation want to say program their favorite channels or whatever, can be put in the middle part of the flip top.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 So it could be accessed by wider range of audience.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 And we can punch in new features such as added features such as shockproof body, and maybe designed to appeal to a lot of people.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 Finding most people prefer user friendly rather than complex remote controls, because there are times like people have used a remote control for, say, a year or something, and they are not used maybe 30 to 40% of the buttons.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 So it is no use of punching in those, trying to put in those things on the top of the remote controls and try to confuse our user.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 As we saw we have to make a profit also.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 So we can maybe go for an economy of a higher production by 50 million we said.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 With that I think we will be able to achieve the economies of scale also.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 So we can add in more features and make it less costly.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 And that is, so this is, if you ask me personally, I would make a flip top with a trendy design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons, whether they are like soft or a little hard because there are times where the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 So in overall the simple and user friendly design, any comments?

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should ask for it at the end.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 So anyone wants to write something down, or want to put them up at the end?

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 I have to move it one time.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_02
 I need to push it a bit more.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_02
 A bit more?

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 I do.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 I want to go a bit more.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Is that okay?

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Just pull it closer a little bit.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 You should be able to.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 Get it right over.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:14:04	None
 Okay.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 I am going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 And obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 So that's where we started.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 We used our usability lab, the company's usability lab.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 We did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public male and female all age groups on 15 upwards.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 And we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 You can see we had 100 subjects there.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 Our findings, lots of findings, I have just summarized some of them here.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_02
 The overall thing, which I have at the top there in italics, is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote control.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that's obvious design implications there.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 We found that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 We were quite surprised by that finding.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 But that's quite a high portion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 But nice looking.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 For example, you can see below there 75% of users zap a lot.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 So you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 So again, there's power implications there.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_02
 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 So again, a big design issue there.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 And possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 The biggest frustrations that people found was regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls are often lost in the room.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's the slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 50% were particularly frustrated by that.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 34% of people said they take too much time to learn to use.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 And I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using 10% of the buttons.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 They just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 You know, there's small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 The vast majority of the 35 and under age group would like a good crystal display and speech recognition.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 Again, that was to aid, I think, in when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 Something we didn't put to them, but which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again till you find it or a flashing light possibly.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 That trend reverses in the older age groups.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 So 35s and unders who would like those two features.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 That kind of evens out 35 to 45s and in the older age group it kind of reverses and not supported with this.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 I had marvelous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 If there's any more information I can email you.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Extra details. Is that okay?

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 We have new project formats.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 We're not going to be using teletext.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 Partly consumers consider outdated for the internet now.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 Our control is only going to be for TV. It's not going to be combined control, which limits all of the different things.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 It limits the cost for us.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 It also makes it easier to understand.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 So can we not program a video with this remote control?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Says for TV only.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 So it looks like this channel.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe Skye, things like that might be incorporated into it.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know what do you think it just said for TV only.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 Would that imply a video using controls?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Do you do video as well?

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you get combined TV and video.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. If you've got Skye, one of those Skye Plus boxes now you can record straight off the TV anyway.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 On to the TV hard drive or something.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've seen it still got small and soft.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 So grabbing.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Anything about that on the market research or something regarding whether people want a combined something on that?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't really look into that, but remember we found that finding that most people only use about 10% of the buttons.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off of the video fast forwarding so on.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a night.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know if that's something we need to do.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Just as an idea on the speech recognition thing.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 It would probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 I've just called up that table there.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions so we didn't differentiate.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 Would you prefer an LCD screen? That's a multifunctional mode.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 And would you pay more for speech recognition and remote control so you can see how the yes, no sort of varies across the age group.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 A substantial number of don't know is in the older age group.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's just general fear of new technology.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 But on that again I just thought because you can get those key chains now and you whistle.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then it allowed for loud noise to let you know where it is.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 So I thought that could be for us.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 So I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kind of thing.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because it is something.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 It needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something you don't lose.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 You're listening to whistling.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 So you can't see the remote. You go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 And it beeps.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's over there.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's a super idea.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 But that sounds a lot cheaper too.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we want logo.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 We want fashionable trendy.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean what you were talking about with the marketing.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 People paying more to loot goods.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 We need to focus on that as well.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Further market research will be needed to focus on what that is.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be different for a 15 year old from somebody who's 60.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 And also across the world of reaming the international market.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 What is attractive to a trending New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 You get the idea.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to vary around the world.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 At the end of the day, the engineering design is one thing.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's the user interface design that may sort of be a fashionable aspect of it.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 We might have to change the different markets around the world.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 So are we talking about a single model or maybe a classic design?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah, you could have a number of different designs.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 I mean inside that would be essentially the same.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_00
 We just could be same in the body, because we're not good at it.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 What about...

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 We were talking about the buttons.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 The controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not tiny, but on big rubber buttons.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 But what about...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, because we've got to make it original.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 What about...

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 You know with the touch screen, you do?

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I was just...

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Which shouldn't wear out as much either.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, no, because you don't actually have to press.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have to press it, you just have to put yourself onto it.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think that might appeal to Japan thinking young office people trendy.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 It will appeal to sections of the market.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 But quite easily labelled so that anyone can...

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, that's obvious what that's for.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 And it's not daunting to maybe the older generation.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, say ergonomics, as we're saying with the different designs.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 Ergonomics, there's sort of physically different things.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you've ever seen the Xbox, they had to make two different sized controllers.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because people in Japan wouldn't buy it.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 Because the controller was physically too big.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because they're cut just generally.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Japanese people have smaller hands.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_03
 So they can get around the controller.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 So if you...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what, because you obviously can have bigger buttons for some countries or something.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 Small ones rather.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe to...

0:23:47	SPEAKER_00
 It was indicated that the risk for the replicated use, the injuries.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 So a touchscreen could be a better option for them.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 So a bigger...

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 You're dividing it according to the countries also, the market.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe for US and all you can have a slightly bigger remote menu.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe in Japan and all you need to have is small.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to design one product.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_01
 And then the company can take it wherever they want to.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 And then they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger, or they can change features slightly.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 The internal engineering design has got to remain the same.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to be the same.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to focus on just one thing.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You can get bogged down in lots of different possibilities.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm concerned when you raise the RSI issue again, the p additive strain injury.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think just moving your finger around in a small screen is going to deal with that enough.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 That is still a kind of question mark issue, how we deal with that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I really can't get my head round.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_02
 This one is me.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_02
 I have to be postponed to a future meeting, but it's something we should think about.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_03
 I was just thinking about how you can combat that.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_03
 Because without doing something where you have to move your arm.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 And it becomes ridiculous.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's the only way that you can avoid that issue.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have to initially, you know, looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially, and then broaden out the market later?

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Do we really have to go for everyone right away?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 Focus on the biggest market.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 When we've been throwing up our ideas, we're automatically talking about business people, young people trying to do it.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 We are talking about the type of company that we're working for as well.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 They want it to be fashionable.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 They want it to be trendy.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 And you wouldn't automatically assume, associate that with the older generation.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 Now, with the baby boomers, the older generation are actually larger.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 They have a greater population than us young people.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think we're focusing on that.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range business kind of class.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 For when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage, we want to waste money, not be profligate.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, focus on where the idea will be taken up.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 First, it's more slightly to be taken up.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, the remote control functions, we've got the TV, we've got the video.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 Now, there's, I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 Video pass.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Is that, I always find that really easy when I discovered it.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because you've got your general record anyway.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 There's a program on you once put the card on, that's fine.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 But if you do want to take something in today's time, you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in, and it's just a number.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not anything like that.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 It's just a number.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 And you wouldn't, you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_03
 You just need to work, because you've already got numbers there.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 You've already got numbers there.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not going to cross that function, but it sounds wonderful.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 It is after, if you look in the newspaper, a TV guide or any TV guide, there's a five, six digit number afterwards, and that's number you put in.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Huh?

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 And it's recorded, but it's going to be on on Tuesday, but ten o'clock, on the seventeenth, things like that, so you don't have to worry about dates, and you don't have to worry about times.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it has been around for a long time.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's been around for a long time.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's just, it's not very well advertised.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think if awareness was kind of much more fun about that.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 So if you've got something like Sky Anyway, you can just click on it, you can just press the button on the program once, and it will record that program.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's on it.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 You press it on it twice, and it will record the whole series.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 So that, yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 But just add that function.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 It would be really good.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just run this past your oil that occurs to me?

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 It occurs to minority producer on mobile phones.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of what led us on to comparing TB remote controls with their design features.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 Chain companies like Carful and Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them, if you've got any problems with it, and they'll fix it before the company, you can use their telephone.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service?

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 So that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, you know, which button is it I press for this?

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a free aspect of our service.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 Would that not make it more attractive to them?

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Mm.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 But the only problem is that with a mobile phone, you sign for a contract.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 So the companies who you deal with have actually got an obligation to help you out and also, I mean, it's fair enough that I have some sort of help service, but I'm not sure how much the cost would be.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing this button and your TB's not doing it.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right. Taking your TB and your phone is saying, look, this is what I'm doing, it's not what the question I do.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel, but I mean, for a three anymore, or are we absolutely deaf and it's only going to be for TB in video?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I mean, no.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Just a thought.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, instruction, but I feel like I'm saying.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, there's customer service.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_01
 There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sure. And that way there's no call out charge. There's no extra person has to walk to your shop in the high street.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I think I'm going to do much of an effort for a person to, for a phone, maybe he might walk down the street.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 But for a remote, he will just...

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Not perception simple functions because we're focusing on that. Yeah.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 We should focus on making manuals user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just trying to write in lots and lots of pages.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 It puts people of reading them, so they just do the obvious.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 That should be something I'm thinking about.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 What other functions that we need?

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if we need a design decision now, but we should think about...

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because you've got the dilemma between old batteries, that's why I think you're back.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 What about phone batteries? What kind of batteries are that?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 That's specially made for the mobile phones.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_03
 But they come with the charger. I mean, you could bundle a charger.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 They've been last quite a long time.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 And if you had... The thing that you get with mobile headphones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or at night or something, but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time when it is charged.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that. Shoot with juice.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if you had one of those, just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper and the rim, it could be on that.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, on that as well.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, are we talking about the concept of a rechargeable?

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, some sort of docking station.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 May charge for a little bit of protection.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, the rechargeable would be your...

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that would be fine. And also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, which is too.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 The shape you've got trendy. I don't want a big box with lots of things.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_01
 You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either because then you have got the repetitive stranger, no matter how much you try and make it simple.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 And we don't want so many remote controls look absolutely identical.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 These long-grown things with the same coloured buttons or crammed in on the surface.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 We definitely, an obvious thing, a very simple thing, is to get away from these brown rectangles. We don't want that.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we've got a flip screen.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 What I was thinking of a design which Nokia came up with almost six or seven years back.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, we have a flat one. It looks like a box, like a chocolate. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, they come up with something like this, curved up. So, here. And you don't have to bend your thumb too much.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's like a banana cutter, kind of curved up with a boat.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's already curved up. So, your thumb doesn't need it.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, we can have a mold it according to your...

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00
 The way you hold up. It's kind of semi-circular in the bottom.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 So, when you look into the company logo, things that are associated with the company, in view to try and incorporate that into the design of the product?

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, for example, if it was a C or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape that opens up kind of like a shell or something.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design, while also making it quite different from anything else you can say.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 If you look at that, what we were talking is to make it more...

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 Other than like, C-shells logo could become...

0:34:36	SPEAKER_00
 You could put a logo in the corner of the model, rather than, you know, trying to make it like a C-shell or whatever you're telling it.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we need to think about how it's going to look different.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's... that sounds really attractive idea.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 If not come across anything like that before, if it kind of...

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and that opens out into your flip-top, then it's nice to...

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_02
 And just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's going to take care of some of the additive strain injury, trying to prevent a lot of it, I think.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a really nice idea.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 And plus, you can get... even though we're using plastic, you can still...

0:35:15	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, think of the design you can get in plastic, you can do a nice C-shell or a scallop shell exterior.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could do different... like you get with mobile phones, different fashers.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 You could have different kind of casings.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 Less chance of it being lost, too. It's not like a chocolate brown-loseenge that's going to go down the sofa.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 People might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever, as if it looks attractive enough.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 As a kind of ornament, and they're not going to lose it so much at all.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's easy to fit nice to handle.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe we could come with some C-56 designs and then choose which one would have been some of those.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_00
 That could be the most common design.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 If you can think of C-56.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right, I think we have to round it out.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements that I haven't missed anything?

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 There's no teletext. It's only for TV and by implication video.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_02
 Corporate image should be incorporated in their remote control.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 Something about video plus.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 That was in cutting down the number. That was kind of separate.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Cutting down the number of odd functions.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 Making it simpler instead of having lots of things.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 So when they press for programming, you can come up on the LCD reminder about using video plus.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that they will look at the guidance.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 Is this nothing to do with the project requirements? Is this just a thumbs up and add on feature?

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the right press for the channel and things like that.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 So it's kind of doing away with the programming feature.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 It could be an advertisement feature rather than design feature.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 You know, draw attention to that and also pay lip service in the instruction manual.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's very simple. So putting it down in words should be helpful.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_01
 And they be chargeable batteries.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Was there anything else there that we...

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 Any new project requirements?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 We've got the button that I think will work through that with the design event.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's not at the moment a requirement. It's something we're looking at.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_02
 Preference. So we come around to market research at some point.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we're talking about there being an alarm or something, a beeping or being lost.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_01
 There aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be fine. And the instruction manual.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we deal with that.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. I'm definitely going to work that way.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. I think that's us.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?

0:38:18	SPEAKER_02
 Or should I just sort of generally look at all the issues?

0:38:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think you might get guided, but...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 I...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_01
 In-sharked manuals.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_01
 Because there tends to be a demonized thing there.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Everyone's got like big pilots and button-on videos.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 Oops.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_02
 Questionnaireful.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yes. Right.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're at lunchtime and now I think...

0:38:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can email me if there's any more questions.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_01
 Absolutely.
