0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay everybody is ready.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning again.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 So today we are going to have a second meeting.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh Michael.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 Hi, you're late.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_02
 You have a good reason for that?

0:00:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 Very good.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's have a look to the agenda today.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_02
 So we are going to have a meeting about the functional design.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 So first before starting, I'm just going to go quickly through the minutes of previous meeting.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 So basically we were not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control but I have new inputs for about that topics.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to share with you.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 And basically we decided to go to individual actions for each of you.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 So industrial designer was supposed to work on the working design.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_02
 You prepare something for us.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_02
 The UE guy also worked on that.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_02
 And for our marketing expert should deliver some specs.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_02
 So we are going to go through three of your individual presentations.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 But first I would like quickly to give a name to the project.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I just put the quick clear remote.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 But if you have any other names that we could decide for just to keep something fun for our project, we could discuss quickly.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 Any ideas?

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 What about the power stick?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 What else?

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 What else?

0:02:41	None
 Maybe a Spanish name.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if we sell it into the US market because there's a lot of Spanish speakers there.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 Mando.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 Mando.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 Mando.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 Mando.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 Mando.

0:03:06	None
 MA.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_02
 D-O.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't sound cool for me.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe for Spanish, for I4.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_00
 What does it mean in Spanish?

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 Control.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 Control.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 Because it also, like in English it sounds like the man's tool, you know, because men like to have control of the remote.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 Mando sounds Latino.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 So let's go for Mando.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Objection.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we could have some like, you could have the fonts, you know, special so you have man in like in one font and then the O is like.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you don't want to cut women out of the potential buyers.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 They're the most TV watchers so we should be careful.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think this is more a question of, I think this is more a question of, of look and feel.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 Something that should be addressed later.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 We should go to the other top.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_03
 Because the product will be international.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's the thing.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on it.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 So let's stick to Mando for the name and we'll see for the look and feel later.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 So let's go for the three presentations right now.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_02
 So we want to start.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe I should just start on the market here.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 So I have your slides somewhere.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 Should be in participant four.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 participant four.

0:04:49	None
 Yeah.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, one.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's coming.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 So I will give a brief outline about what I prepared for this meeting for the functional requirements and especially for the user requirements.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 I prepared a marketing report and just to find the weaknesses and the improvements we could do to the current remote controls.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 And also I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 It seems that the remote controls have remained the same for the last five, ten years.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 There is no significant difference between the first new controls.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:06:11	None
 Okay.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, directly.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 So and they admitted that they should spend more money in a fancier remote control, which is good.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Interesting point.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_03
 Also, the people are worried about the air as I disease, which is if you repeat the same movement, which is not a with a not very appropriate device, you will have problems when you will get all.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 So people are worried about the shape of the remote control.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it would be a good point to find a solution to any beep, any alarm or something incorporated with the remote control every time it gets lost.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 And also I found that the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the remote control.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 So in my opinion, the Mando is Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is, the more like the the likelier is to get lost likelier or more likely more likely like like.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 People are so complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons which are not very used like memorizing channels or all these kind of actions which are not very often.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 But they should they shouldn't have the same importance in the remote control.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Also the design should fit the hand shape.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 So it may be interesting to to think in both prototypes for right and left handed people.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the thing is the most remote controls they use by more than one person.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 So unless you're kind of targeting single people, you know, you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if any way I think it could be interesting to to release some a small fraction of.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, my face could be a universal design.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 A universal design which is which is good for both the hands.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, still straight for yeah for your hand but not for a particular.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, whether it's left hand or right hand but but don't you think that the two points are clashing one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 The first and the third point they are clashing.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well it can still be a bit you can still extend past the hand.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it means like this right here is kind of is very thin and long.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 So instead of having you know you might have it kind of yeah a bit bigger or you know with maybe some some finger molds or something.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 So means design should be similar to that traditional ones.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Little sleek longer.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking of like something.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 Something with the shape of the pan.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 Some finger grips maybe you could even have some buttons like you know.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it should be symmetrical.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 Not anymore.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's what.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 And then finally.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 And finally the incorporation of LCD or a specific condition system in the remote control could also be interested but I don't know if the budget would be larger.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 First I'm just wondering about the LCD stuff.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_03
 But most of the young people to 30 to 30 years old were really interested in this kind of technology.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe it's a good time for me to to bring you to some new new information.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 You had the new requirements from the head of thesis of the company and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to TV.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you had this information already.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 So they want has to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 They want also.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 So this marketing report is restricted to TV remote control.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well TLA text is how they did now.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_02
 And finally it should be clear that the corporate image that means color and logos of the car our company should be clearly identified in the product.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 Are we still working on this 25 euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remote out there this is quite a low price.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 If we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe you can jump to your presentations right now.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_02
 So let's keep in mind about that this last point about LCD and speech.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think even if it was within budget to speech record rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching TV you're going to have a lot of this background noise from the TV which might interfere with the.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 What is your following?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Ah, participant three.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 Press a button to talk and the TV.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 10 and 50.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 10 so. Yeah, no it could be command control kind of thing.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 It require recognizes particular sequence and then it gets activated.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Means you say you should say like this that remote control being on or beyond kind of thing and then remote control comes into the picture for the speech recognition.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the TV also.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So there should be something command controlled you start and then you stop.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you're going to be a editor you are having two modes similarly.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise it's just like idle.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 So could I describe the mouse maybe a bit easier to use the mouse or.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:13:09	None
 Okay.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 The wheel doesn't work.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 So while researching this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote and just look to see if they're actually available in any current remotes and then also search for which are the top rated remote controls on opinions.com which is a you know a customer written basically review site.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_00
 So there's a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant but it's not really, it's by no means you know on its own in being so expensive there are a lot of expensive remote control out there.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 It looks like a PDA.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well basically all the functions are controlled through the LCD screen except for the really really kind of main functions which have a couple of of their own buttons.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 And if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market I know we're working on television remote but a lot of the universal remotes out there have LCD screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions different functions on the screen at different times.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control and it's kind of difficult to see in this light but it has a scroll wheel on it which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect because the thing is what the presentation is about is what we want the remote control to actually do and obviously the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just changes the channel.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think that a scroll wheel is actually a pretty handy way of changing the channel because I know when I use the remote to change the channel I rarely use the numbers on the pad I usually use the up and down because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press a special button to enter a two digit number and then the number so it's annoying.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I think a scroll wheel is quite handy.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 Now the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an LCD screen and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 One possibility if we, now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for 25 euro but one possibility is to download program information into the LCD screen so that instead of actually saying I want to go to channel 37 because I know this program is on you know often you don't know what channel it's on or you don't know what's on.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 If you have a list of programs on your LCD screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 So if you think about it's kind of like you know in mobile phones now you don't use, you don't remember people's phone number you remember the name and you go find that name and ring it.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 So this would be pretty kind of anything to have but we really need to discuss the price.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean there are cheaper, this is another multi-purpose remote control where it's very simple there's only a few buttons but each of those buttons does something different in a different context.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 So this is something else we might want to consider is really kind of limiting the number of buttons because this is the top rating universal remote control on opinions.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control and give them a saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used tasks.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 But I think also you know the location and shape of the buttons is important but also the number of buttons so if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 But when this one problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah well because the same button is doing to anything.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing a television remote control.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip open door that you have hidden most of the time but contains the extra buttons like say the number of buttons for instance.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 I would if I had my perfect remote control I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way they don't really do anything.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you know although I do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever but maybe a door that you can permanently remove or permanently have on would be good.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 But I think definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum but not the let that kind of interfere with the functionality of the device.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think that the transition to this new remote control shouldn't be very abrupt, very hard because if people see a remote control without numbers they will think it's very difficult to learn, very difficult to build.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 It does something more important.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 Very different too.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 It depends on how you market it if you have the right advertisements showing how easy it is and how you can navigate to a program without the numbers then people might say that looks pretty easy.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay can you continue please mate?

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay so I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a program driven interface rather than the channel number.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can have a higher priced remote control it would really be worth something that would be worth implementing.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_00
 There's the LCD screen which maybe is too expensive but I think also the scroll wheel I haven't mentioned it here, the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen just for changing channel numbers easily.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think even that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an LCD screen to implement but I think it would be quite useful as well.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 And the other thing you said we need to keep it just television but I think maybe one option since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device is you know there's a certain kind of cool or well factor that you can have with technology and maybe we want to make it something that's extensible to do other tasks.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 Say you have like another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well the television where you can say change the lighting in the room.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 That would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development but you know later on you could, you know, you're also selling the potential of the device then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, I don't know close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's something we may need to have as is at least as an optional extra to kind of make out product cool since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay thanks.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you want to go?

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 Give me.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 So most of the things that you are discussing about a speech recognition are on my own end.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it should be.

0:21:03	None
 Great.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Nope, that's one.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's your two.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the working design is user interface could be of two types.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 One is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he's doing some he's knowing about the technology.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 So he's pretty comfortable if he wants to get this and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the remote.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes it can be useful for them.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 And the new users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new guest mode which is speech recognition kind of thing.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, sorry to interrupt you but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway that didn't come into my mind.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 So that is a possibility.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 These could be other kind of interfaces.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 It means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different kind of interfaces.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 So speed buttons are something which is very everybody's familiar with.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 And on top of that if we are having extra functionality if I are willing to shell the 25 euros money which we are thinking otherwise we are just like others in the market.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway that is the first user interface could be of more than one type and yeah that means we can do the online changes which cannot be done now actually.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 So apart from speech we can have this crawl kind of thing with the buttons.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Now for buttons normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 And for voice limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah that increases the cost also.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's right but means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 that. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to target of such technologies is enough?

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yes if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 We can target means we can target 95% accuracy or somewhere.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambient microphone because you are not going to speak.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 No it could be a little joke.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be a few centimeters.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 One other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets though because I'm not sure exactly where we are going to sell this but I presume it's not just going to be English speaking countries.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 So then you have to train models for...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 It's more like there are different speech technologies which are existing.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 So DTW could be kind of which is the easiest.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to store some templates on the chip itself and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having a model which is to be trained and being a microcontroller.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay we should discuss that later after this slide.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 This is a very important issue in the discussion.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay next.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's finished.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 No no.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 Components.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 Components.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go to the next slide.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah sure.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 So we are having the power button and the switch which is not much and then we are having the bulb with us which is to indicate whether the power is on or not.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then there are two kind of things which can be...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 So one is the button interface which has not been shown because of lack of time.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we could not put that.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 So now where the ASR decoder is sitting.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 So there is ASR decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button, scroll, scroller and then there could be buttons.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 And all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the proper message format and then there is the chip which is sitting, the green one and it converts it into bitcodes and that bitcodes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the easiest design that they could be.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 So in ASR decoder we can have things in parallel to have different technologies.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 So this was the...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 My personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah I guess you could actually train the remote control as you are using it by saying you know, turn volume up and you press the button like people teach sign language to kids.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, by speaking and doing it.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 As soon as you try to put a microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the slight problems.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 So your opinion is that we should go for our subconscious.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the reason is that if we go into the market means, though I do not have much idea, but as the marketing expert presentation was.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 If you can sell a speech recognition remote control for 25 euros, everyone will buy it.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 So if you go on the job show.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, if I was using remote control to say turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well, I don't really want to drown out what people are saying by talking, you know, when I'm instead of pressing up on the remote control.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_00
 You know, there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to actually find out what's being said.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, but you know the average frequency of passion bottoms it's about.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it depends if it's a remote control.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's about 80, 80, 80 pashes per hour or something like that.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if the remote control is something that you don't actually have to pick up anymore, that would be a useful feature of the speech recognition.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, gentlemen, we have to take some decisions right now.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 So if I kind of summarize everything we say, while targeting TV, we need to have remote control which is fancy, which is easy to handle, to spoil, not too big.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 We have a good shape for that.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 A good shape, yes.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 We should bring new technologies for young people's.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 And as we have also requirements to use to push through the internet, maybe this is something we can stick to it.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 And also very interesting things I've seen on one of our competitors, this wheel that we can use to navigate.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 So my feeling is that regarding costs, budgets we have and target price, it's not possible to go to LCD and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 First, why not to go to LCD?

0:28:30	SPEAKER_02
 Because in fact, as we are targeting TV, in fact we can use TV screen as a screen to feedback, to give some feedback information about what we could have.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it depends.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 Unless we have some input, some video input to the TV, or we have control over the TV, then we can't actually display that.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_00
 Like if we produce the TV, then we can put menus up there.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_00
 But otherwise we need to actually have something sitting in between the video signal and the TV to superimpose those menus.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 So that's an extra...

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 Don't we have contacts?

0:29:08	SPEAKER_02
 We have people on TV or systems that exist in use?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 This is another...

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 We still haven't really defined the remote.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Are we still...

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 You said we're focusing on TV, but is it still kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control?

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 Or is this something for our own line of televisions?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 Because that really makes a big difference.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_00
 Because even if we have contacts, we can't really produce remote control that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's just there are too many TVs out there.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really...

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good point.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 What could be the cost of...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, could we fit the targets in terms of cost if we go to LCD and remote control?

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 For 25-year?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's impossible.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's impossible.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that Li-Wei in that 25-year?

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 Because for 25-year, I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_00
 That seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company, which is putting the fashion into electronics.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 I would like to know if there's any chance of increasing the unit price.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 What would be...

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 So, you mean we should target something maybe which would be more expensive, but really fancy in terms to have really an added value?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because...

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think this is...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 Well, question.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 What would be the goal of putting a LCD in remote control?

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of information?

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can have things like the program name instead of the channel number.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 But it's like an interactive program.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 Most of the TVs know where they are.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 They have teletext.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 Show the...

0:31:03	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because they have teletext on it.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 You have a teletext signal that you can...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_03
 But most of the TVs have teletext nowadays.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 They have...

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 Most of them have teletext, but we want to get rid...

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, one of our requirements is to move to teletext to the use of internet.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, to...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 You can get a lot more information.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 It grows more easily in the teletext, for instance, through your remote control.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 So, what would appear in the LCD?

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 So you could have the name of the program.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 You could have the start time, you know, where it's up to...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 To start all the programs you could have...

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 You could have even a little image of, you know, the main actors or something.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_00
 So you can quickly just kind of even without reading...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if this information is available from teletext also.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_00
 Well, no, but there are other electronic program guides.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 They may not have pictures, but maybe they do.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 It also depends on the country.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 For the same reason that we cannot overlay information on the TV.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_02
 We couldn't grab information which is not there.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 No, but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's impossible that there are people out there providing that.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, I mean we need an extra internet connection to use the remote control if you're on the browser.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 In addition to the TV.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 Or it should be a special TV connection.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think you could even get teletext information from the TV onto the remote control.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if we don't control the TV.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, we need to find that out.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_02
 We need to close the meeting.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 So just a small thing.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of market we are targeting?

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market or what?

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 That is very important.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 If it's a really small TV.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 People go through buying another remote control when they broke.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 Broke.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_02
 Broke they hold and they want to go for universal one and they take the fanciest they can have.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 So this is that we should target.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 So the commitment is following.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 We don't go for speech recognition technology.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 The LCD is still open to discussion.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 It is up to you to go through this way and to report me back next meeting.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper than the LCD.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but not sure.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's cheaper but we have no...

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 Because with the LCD you need more requirements.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 You need internet connection.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 You need more things.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 But for the speech recognition you don't need anything.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 You have to say, China 50 and that's it.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think the type of people that are going to want to buy a very stylish remote control with lots of new technologies is the kind of people that are going to have a wireless internet connection maybe or...

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 But then we should move to another target because at $25.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 This is for $25.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 Can we increase the price point of this remote control?

0:34:28	SPEAKER_00
 Because otherwise we need...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, this is not one question for you.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is up to you to tell us.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm definitely not keen on...

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 To move to another target?

0:34:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not confident enough.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure that we have a product.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 Really that work.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 That work.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're going to...

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, how to guarantee such performances is very hard.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_03
 The expert said 95%.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_00
 95% is not good enough.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's very bad.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the end of this discussion.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Next meeting, you have the task you have to work on.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_02
 So you have to work on the component concept.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 You have to work on user interface.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 And you have to go through a trend watching.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_02
 So the question is still open about the LCD thing.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 I hope that next meeting we will take some decisions that are there.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 Bye!

0:36:11	None
 this.
