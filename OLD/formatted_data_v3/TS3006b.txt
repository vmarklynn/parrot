None: it's not even cheap greenhouse Editor for that reason.
None: No.
None: Ah yeaahahah.
None:!
Speaker C: I didn't see it yet I think.
Speaker A: Did I miss something?
Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much.
Speaker C: I thought I'd come and mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in.
Speaker D: Hey, what's wrong with my computer?
None: It's an iconita who is telling you.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's my presentation.
Speaker A: Oh, right.
Speaker D: Hey, everybody ready?
Speaker D: Sorry, I'm not a good player.
Speaker D: Okay, where do I find this?
Speaker A: I'm not a good player.
Speaker A: And then, I'm a paradise.
Speaker B: You read the new flash?
Speaker C: No, what was it?
Speaker C: Oh, no, press it.
Speaker D: Yeah, no, but my screen is reduced in size.
Speaker C: What?
Speaker D: Feedback?
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: I'll delete.
Speaker B: Let's see.
Speaker B: So it doesn't draw the attention away.
Speaker A: I made my own map.
Speaker D: No, not this, but the task.
Speaker D: No, I just flipped it, close it, took it here and then this happened.
Speaker D: And that's not the way it's.
Speaker D: Where was it?
Speaker D: It's settings.
Speaker B: Okay, all right.
Speaker D: Thank you.
Speaker D: Do you guys like your task?
Speaker D: I get my function, you know, the information that I need.
Speaker B: So frustrating.
Speaker B: Yeah, I don't like the end and just typing it to that.
Speaker D: Oh, I have to do that.
Speaker D: So, this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas because I hadn't time to integrate the information yet.
Speaker C: Really annoying.
Speaker C: I'm not sure.
Speaker C: I'm not sure.
Speaker B: I'm not sure.
Speaker B: I'm not sure.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So, I'm going to talk about functional requirements.
Speaker B: Well, some research has been done, has been done, observing of 100 subjects and usability lab using the remote control.
Speaker B: They also fill in a questionnaire.
Speaker B: The findings were, well, you can see them for yourself.
Speaker B: They dislike to look at field current remote controls.
Speaker B: They're ugly.
Speaker B: They do not match the operating behavior of the user, so they don't match what they want to have on it.
Speaker B: They're often lost somewhere in the room.
Speaker B: It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.
Speaker B: And they're bad for error's eye.
Speaker B: I don't know how a user can read that, but okay.
Speaker B: There was also research on the most relevant and irrelevant functions.
Speaker B: Most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono stereo, pitch, bass, screen settings for brightness and color and stuff like that.
Speaker B: But they are used.
Speaker B: They do need to be under remote control.
Speaker B: And if you can't control the sound settings, I mean, if you dislike a very loud bass or something, you need to change that.
Speaker B: Yeah, we have to.
Speaker B: If he doesn't have an equalizer.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we can't, my TV has, but we can leave them away.
Speaker B: Most relevant and most used functions, they speak for themselves, I guess.
Speaker B: Power button, channel volume selection, daily text, but we can skip that because I saw the new slash and daily text is so outdated that it should not be used anymore in the future.
Speaker B: So forget this one and channel settings.
Speaker B: So for programming your channels in the right order.
Speaker D: Where did you guys get that new slash?
Speaker D: Yeah, I didn't get anything.
Speaker B: On the project.
Speaker C: Not by mail.
Speaker C: I received mail, but you don't.
Speaker B: No, so it's a text file in the project folder.
Speaker B: So daily text can be skipped.
Speaker C: That's in the presentation.
Speaker B: There was some research on new features in the remote control about an LCD screen and speech recognition.
Speaker B: Well, we got an update for the audience or the targeted group.
Speaker B: So it's above 40, I guess.
Speaker B: The new product or below.
Speaker B: Because that's pretty relevant.
Speaker B: I thought our ads.
Speaker C: Our current customers are in the age group 40 plus.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: And the new product should reach new markets.
Speaker C: Below.
Speaker B: Okay, well.
Speaker B: That's in the new.
Speaker B: Okay, that's good to know.
Speaker B: Because you see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features.
Speaker B: And above 40 people are not so interested in the screen or speech recognition.
Speaker B: But below that age they pretty much are.
Speaker B: So I think we can build that in.
Speaker B: Yeah, well, we can skip this part as well because I thought our ad above 40.
Speaker B: So we could skip the features, but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting.
Speaker B: Well, we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible.
Speaker B: And also, so not only the design of the buttons but how you can push them and stuff like that.
Speaker B: So the physical aspect of it.
Speaker B: And I think certainly for the lower age groups, a nice design.
Speaker B: Which does not make the remote control or no to stay in your room.
Speaker B: It's actually a part of your interior of your design in your room.
Speaker B: So the people can say, whoa, what's that?
Speaker B: Well, that's my remote control.
Speaker B: So it has to look nice and feel nice and have all the functions.
Speaker C: But it also needs to have corporate identity.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So the logo has to be present and the colors as well.
Speaker C: We can change much of that.
Speaker B: Two years.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But I don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a color anyway.
Speaker B: And most of the time there is a brand present on it.
Speaker B: So I think that's not going to affect it very much.
Speaker B: But that are the consequences of the marketing part.
Speaker C: It's open already so you can use all top.
Speaker A: Oh, you're here.
Speaker C: Oh, no.
Speaker A: You pressed all the four?
Speaker A: No, no, no.
Speaker A: I pressed the mouse button.
Speaker D: Oh, great.
Speaker D: That's a self-destruct button.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Maybe you can do it from your computer.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: And if you go stand around here.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: Sure.
Speaker C: All right.
Speaker C: That's nice.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: All right.
Speaker A: I had two examples.
Speaker A: This one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons.
Speaker A: This is the easy one.
Speaker A: I think we have to combine them.
Speaker A: And yeah, merge the best functions of all examples.
Speaker A: But yeah, the H is under 40.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And marketing research stated that that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions.
Speaker A: So not too much.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: We do have to integrate the screen and the speech recognition.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker A: All right.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: This one we can remove for kids.
Speaker A: It's just only for adults.
Speaker A: So we can use some advanced options.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: From age of 16.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: But I prefer we use the basic options.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: We have to make them very easy.
Speaker A: So for just zipping around channels, you can just push one button.
Speaker A: But if you want to use your video recorder or something else, you should use an advanced option.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But the news flash also stated that it should control only one device.
Speaker B: So only your television.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: So it's very easy.
Speaker B: Now, yeah.
Speaker A: So there are not extra options in this case.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Also, yeah.
Speaker A: We have to make it fashionable.
Speaker A: Yeah.
None: You want to set it before.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: The basic functions.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Only use the extra functions if they are really needed.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: So maybe you can hide them or something.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Well, what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options.
Speaker B: You can put that in the screen.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Screen menu to do that.
Speaker B: And then the basic function just under defies itself.
Speaker B: So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen with a clear menu.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Uh, functionality is the screen.
Speaker C: What does the screen do?
Speaker C: All right.
Speaker B: All right.
Speaker C: It's low on power.
Speaker C: What are they?
Speaker B: So what does the screen do?
Speaker C: They said they needed it.
Speaker C: What does it do?
Speaker C: What do they want?
Speaker A: For the advanced functions, I think.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Well, it didn't say what they want to do with the screen.
Speaker B: My guess is pretty handy for advanced functions.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker B: Searching for channels.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Searching for channels.
Speaker B: Programming them.
Speaker A: Nevermind.
Speaker A: I'm almost finished.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: We have to watch out for the, if we make it very fashionable, the functionality will go down.
Speaker A: So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashion.
Speaker A: Complement them for them.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: That was the end.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Well, my presentation is a bit sucky.
Speaker D: Well, you can improvise, right?
Speaker D: Yeah, a little bit.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker C: Do you think there are requirements?
Speaker D: Yeah, I think that will be it.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker B: So we can go for it.
Speaker D: That was, you know, you know.
Speaker D: Let me check.
Speaker C: It's not really English.
Speaker D: I know.
Speaker C: The kickoff.
Speaker C: Our working design.
Speaker C: We got it.
Speaker B: So we can go for the look and feel of the left example and then a screen on top of it.
Speaker C: Here you go.
Speaker D: All right.
Speaker D: How do I skip pages?
Speaker C: Just press the keys.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: All right.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Well, I was working on this before I got my information.
Speaker D: So I was just working off the top of my head using my common knowledge about remote controls and, well, the info on the website, which came to it.
Speaker D: So I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet.
Speaker D: This is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting.
Speaker D: Those were my starting points.
Speaker D: I was working on a, yeah, on a schedule and I was supposed to do it like this, but, yeah.
Speaker D: Then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow.
Speaker D: So I was trying to organize them for myself and then make the design, the design, the actual design, but I never came around to do that.
Speaker D: So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it.
Speaker D: I mean, everything speaks for itself, I guess.
Speaker D: I mean, you press a button, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequency.
Speaker D: Yeah, frequency.
Speaker D: And our temporal frequencies, actually, and then through a transformer, the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the TV to feel translated into the function.
Speaker D: Yeah, well, this was actually all I got around to do.
Speaker D: I mean, I don't know if I'm too slow for this stuff, but then work harder.
Speaker A: Should we make a list of all the functions we want to...
Speaker B: Yeah, we want to incorporate into it.
Speaker C: Okay, for those that didn't see yet, the basic new requirements of the management were no-time text, only for TV.
Speaker C: It should be designed for a user group below 40, but I don't think it's wrong if we can target the current customer group as well.
Speaker C: And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.
Speaker C: And we have to decide on the functions and on the...
Speaker C: Let's see, what was it?
Speaker C: The target group.
Speaker C: We have to make me clear what that is.
Speaker B: The target group of users?
Speaker B: Yeah, it uses.
Speaker B: Because it says below 40, I mean...
Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's easy, but...
Speaker B: Yeah, or male and female.
Speaker B: Or in just...
Speaker B: No, it's below 40.
Speaker B: The marketing research started on the age of 16, 16 to 25, 25 to 35, 35 to 45, something like that.
Speaker C: So below 40 is okay, but we need an lower level in which to...
Speaker C: How do you miss?
Speaker C: So is it from 16 to 40?
Speaker C: Is it from 20 to 40?
Speaker B: Yeah, it's from 16 to 40.
Speaker B: I guess people of 16 are quite used to technology.
Speaker B: So they adapted pretty soon, I guess.
Speaker A: If we have a larger public, we have more options to sell our product.
Speaker D: Yeah, so what we might want to do is...
Speaker D: Yeah, have customized the screen functions, if you know what I mean.
Speaker D: Younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines, they can use more advanced functions, but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well.
Speaker D: So they need a simpler remote.
Speaker D: And that you can choose what the design displays or whatever.
Speaker A: That's right, I wanted to make two different groups of functions.
Speaker A: The simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced.
Speaker B: But they all incorporate it in the screen or just on the remote itself.
Speaker A: I should put the advanced options onto the screen display.
Speaker B: Yeah, like you have a visual of the brightness with a sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and visuals.
Speaker C: You should have a menu for all the issues.
Speaker B: Make a drawing.
Speaker B: Select.
Speaker B: That's okay.
Speaker C: That's very big.
Speaker C: Yeah, we get there.
Speaker B: Yeah, well, this is basically a remote.
Speaker B: Usually the power button is on top, I guess.
Speaker C: It should fit right into your hand.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker B: Most people are right-handed, so maybe less than a special decision, but okay.
Speaker B: If you put it like here or something, I don't know.
Speaker B: Then you can put a screen on a mobile phone, also on top, I guess.
Speaker A: Yeah, but if you are using the normal functions, the basic functions, you normally do this.
Speaker C: So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb, also reach the middle, or you should screen at the bottom.
Speaker C: Then you can see it very clearly.
Speaker B: Okay, so you have your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle.
Speaker B: For example, if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the layouts.
Speaker B: It doesn't work too well.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: Right.
Speaker B: Okay, you get it.
Speaker B: For example, if you put all the...
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker C: You want the normal piece of paper and there's a 10?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah, my piece is...
Speaker B: Kind of works.
Speaker B: Like if you have 10 buttons for all the channels, an ear button for flipping.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: And the following?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That's usually like here, here, here, here.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So we have up and down for the channels.
Speaker B: Left and right.
Speaker B: Left and right for the volume.
Speaker C: Those can also be used for the menu.
Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: But this is really your department that we need just functional displays.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And for a cursor, this is function.
Speaker B: And you...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: If you can use the...
Speaker B: Most of the time you have one button in the middle.
Speaker B: It says menu.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And then if you press it, the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down.
Speaker B: And left and right to go into a function.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And then just...
Speaker B: Most of the time this menu button is also like, okay, to confirm a kind of action.
Speaker B: So you scroll into it, okay, you select a function like base.
Speaker B: You just adjust it with these two buttons.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Then okay to confirm.
Speaker B: And then on each screen, this should be an option to go back to an upper level.
Speaker B: And then finally say, okay, exit or one button to exit it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: In one time, I don't know that's not really my department.
Speaker B: That's more your department too.
Speaker A: It's a logo on the remote control.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But it should be if the screen is here, then the logo should be on top.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean, it's...
Speaker C: Yeah, but that depends on where you put the screen.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's essential that there is a screen.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean, the position of the screen is also more essential than...
Speaker B: I mean, we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there.
Speaker C: And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need the microphone.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: So it should be...
Speaker B: I mean, if you have it in your hand here, it should be on top somewhere.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: Why do we want to put the display in the bottom?
Speaker C: No, that's not sure.
Speaker C: That's not sure, but...
Speaker B: Maybe.
Speaker B: Maybe.
Speaker D: Because if you use the functions, your hand will block the display.
Speaker A: Yeah, okay.
Speaker A: But that's only for the basic function.
Speaker A: If you are going to use the iPhone option, you are going to press the menu button and then...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean, the screen on top looks more...
Speaker B: Normal.
Speaker B: Logical to me also because people use mobile phones and they also have a screen on top.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean, if you grab it...
Speaker B: Once it's on, it's on.
Speaker B: But most of the times, if a TV is on standby, people just press the check.
Speaker B: Yeah, we put it on top.
Speaker B: So we put this on top and then make the corporate logo like over here, R-R.
Speaker B: And the microphone, I mean, it can be very small if you look at your mobile phone.
Speaker B: So these are some stripes, little holes.
Speaker D: Maybe on the top or even on the side.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Maybe on the side, I mean, if the microphone is good...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: So on the top is better.
Speaker D: But if you hold the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side, I don't know.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: It should be able to...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It doesn't...
Speaker D: It doesn't...
Speaker D: Okay, well, leave this up to you.
Speaker B: Yeah, it doesn't matter that much.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: But the screen is on top.
Speaker B: Which functions did we have left?
Speaker B: I mean, this is basically numbers for you.
Speaker B: For you.
Speaker B: For you.
Speaker B: Channel up and down.
Speaker B: Channel up and down.
Speaker C: Up there.
Speaker C: Outphones options.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Maybe we should decide what outphones options we want to put in the LCD screen.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That's a good one.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So we needed to integrate those sound and image options, right?
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: Like...
Speaker D: Sound.
Speaker D: Sound.
Speaker D: So we need kind of an equalizer.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Equalizer.
Speaker B: So if you have sound.
Speaker B: But not too advanced.
Speaker B: Most TVs use only treble and bass.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Treble and middle bass or something.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: It's pretty hard to write.
Speaker B: And...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: But you have sound?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Sound.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: You have a digital...
Speaker B: Better write it down over there.
Speaker B: So we have sound.
Speaker B: Just a...
Speaker B: Secret.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Sound.
Speaker B: And then...
Speaker B: Within sound, I guess, treble and bass.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: The mono stereo option.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: And also...
Speaker D: There was something else also.
Speaker D: And then...
Speaker D: Pitch.
Speaker B: Pitch.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But pitch isn't that...
Speaker B: Yeah, that's the height.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: The frequency is down.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Why would you use that?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Isn't this...
Speaker D: It depends on the signal of the program you're watching.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: And also the tuning part?
Speaker B: Programming part.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Channel programming.
Speaker B: So we have sound, yeah.
Speaker B: Channel programming.
Speaker B: And...
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: In the functionality of the...
Speaker D: Telefician.
Speaker D: No, no.
Speaker D: Of the remote.
Speaker D: Do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them?
Speaker D: As a confirmation?
Speaker D: Or whatever, you know?
Speaker D: I don't know.
Speaker B: I think it gets annoying.
Speaker B: I mean, most mobile phones use that in the beginning.
Speaker A: But...
Speaker A: You can disable...
Speaker D: Under the advanced option.
Speaker D: You can put those in.
Speaker A: The...
Speaker A: The telefician itself has also the options with brightness and screen color, etc.
Speaker A: So...
Speaker A: Contrast.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But people don't want to sit underneath...
Speaker B: Underneath in front of the telefician which is usually only three buttons and it's very hard to.
Speaker B: Contrast.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Contrast and brightness.
None: Point.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That's the most used, I guess, if you don't get your money turned.
Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess this were the only ones, I guess.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: It's easy.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: But so we have...
Speaker D: We have TV options which is all this.
Speaker D: The sound...
Speaker C: The options.
Speaker D: The sound image.
Speaker D: And you have in the...
Speaker D: The...
Speaker D: Indeed.
Speaker D: The remote control options.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So we need two menus kind of thing.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: You have basically a button menu which you can use directly.
Speaker C: Uh-huh.
Speaker C: According to the opris port and the LCD options.
Speaker C: Are activated based on some software options that's communicated with the infrared.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: With the chip and then trans...
Speaker B: I mean...
Speaker C: So you have an additional processor in.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Well...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: We have power button, whether that's present.
Speaker B: Channel volume selection present.
Speaker B: Numbers present.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Audio settings, monosterior pitch, bass, treble, screen settings, brightness and color.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Contrast this.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Color and brightness.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Um...
Speaker B: And which is a channel setting.
Speaker B: So channel programming.
Speaker B: So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And when it encounters one.
Speaker B: Well, it shows on your TV.
Speaker B: And then you can...
Speaker B: Um...
Speaker B: Uh...
Speaker B: And then you can select a number in your remote.
Speaker C: So the channel program is auto-seek.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Auto-seek.
Speaker B: Uh...
Speaker C: Name a channel.
Speaker C: Or...
Speaker B: Well, most TVs automatically display the name which they get through the cable.
Speaker C: Oh, they get the ultimate name.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: So you only have to choose the position on your...
Speaker B: It only has to match the channel frequency on your TV.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: With the position on your TV.
Speaker B: And so your remote.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: But can you also say I want Veronica on the channel number 5?
Speaker B: If you already programmed it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: If you want to move it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That should be possible too.
Speaker B: How do you call that?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: How do you call that?
None: Mmm.
Speaker B: Well, you should be able to browse through a list or something which displays all the values, all the channels which are possible.
Speaker B: I mean like 1 to 30 or 4.9 here or whatever.
Speaker B: Just browse through it and then...
Speaker B: Um...
Speaker B: Some kind of way.
Speaker B: See if it is programmed.
Speaker C: Swap channels?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Swap channels.
Speaker C: Swap is good option.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: So most of the time, if you swap it.
Speaker B: Let's say for example you have RTL5 on channel 5.
Speaker B: And Veronica on channel 8 and you want to move Veronica to channel 5.
Speaker B: Most of the time you overwrite the previous one.
Speaker C: Well, that's sort of...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: It's pretty...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I mean you have to look on the menu.
Speaker D: Those are working.
Speaker D: On the TV.
Speaker C: Also.
Speaker D: He only has to figure out how it has to look.
Speaker C: Yeah, but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result.
Speaker C: Yeah, okay.
Speaker C: The working design was to specify how the physical interaction between the components was.
Speaker C: I...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: It treated your homework.
Speaker D: But um...
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: Or is it too hard to just do it on your remote to program the channels?
Speaker D: No.
Speaker C: It should be able to do a thing with the television is difficult.
Speaker C: But that's not our part.
Speaker C: No.
Speaker C: We don't have to design protocol.
Speaker B: That's true.
Speaker B: That's true.
Speaker B: Thank God.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So we have to figure out a way to do that easily.
Speaker B: I mean the auto-secret is not a problem.
Speaker B: You are a counter-channel and then it just says on which number do you want to save this?
Speaker B: And you just press the number on your remote and then say confirm.
Speaker B: And it's safe.
Speaker B: It's easier.
Speaker B: It's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to swap.
Speaker C: So we have to think of something for that.
Speaker C: The user interface design can design a menu for all the use functions.
Speaker B: Kind of structure into layers.
Speaker A: I mean you make a map with all the...
Speaker A: Yeah, because it's now...
Speaker A: There are also documents.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah, I can.
Speaker C: I'll just try to reorganize things.
Speaker C: So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen.
Speaker B: And the layout of the thing itself.
Speaker B: I think the layout of the screen.
Speaker C: I think you can concentrate more on the bit and placement and the placement of the screen itself on the...
Speaker A: Isn't that more than the...
Speaker A: This is the interface.
Speaker C: No, I think there's more in...
Speaker D: All the functional aspects of the...
Speaker D: Maybe more than...
Speaker D: I think I am in my department.
Speaker D: I have to know what it has to do.
Speaker D: So if you want to...
Speaker D: You know, the changing the channels kind of thing is...
Speaker D: I have to integrate that in the design.
Speaker C: So you lay out your function.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: One function, okay.
Speaker D: I think that's a good example.
Speaker A: I have to make the menu layout also.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: I guess so.
Speaker C: I think that's your department.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: We have to kind of work together.
Speaker D: If I make the...
Speaker D: The menu, like...
Speaker D: I have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it in the way that is your friend.
Speaker A: You are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the menu screen.
Speaker A: And I'm going to make a nice menu.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: With some layers in it.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: And also...
Speaker C: Make clear which buttons to press to get certain results.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Because that's always difficult to every device that's on...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I guess this button, the okay menu, okay.
Speaker B: Or you can incorporate two different buttons like you have on your mobile phone.
Speaker B: So this is only to get in the menu or to exit it.
Speaker B: And then I want to confirm.
Speaker B: I want to go one step back.
Speaker B: So it's like the the say button on your mobile phone if you have a Nokia or like that or the no button.
Speaker B: To go one step back, it's only two extra buttons.
Speaker B: If it's very clear that they are for the screen.
Speaker A: I think we have to make two groups.
Speaker A: One group for the display and one group for the basic functions.
Speaker C: Yeah, but they're incorporated.
Speaker A: Yeah, because this is used for both.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: But maybe that's not...
Speaker A: If you're zapping with your remote control, you can press the menu button and then you are suddenly into the...
Speaker B: To your screen.
Speaker B: Okay, so you should leave the menu button out of here.
Speaker B: And just put it under the screen.
Speaker A: Just group.
Speaker A: Yeah, we make these advanced functions and these basic functions.
Speaker A: We make a line between them.
Speaker B: But we should place the screen on top, right?
Speaker A: Well, oh yeah, okay.
Speaker A: We swap the...
Speaker C: You use the port.
Speaker C: Yeah, you just find out and then the headlady is out.
Speaker C: Do we do the extra two buttons or not?
Speaker D: I think you should.
Speaker D: It's easier if you put too many functions in one button, it gets confusing.
Speaker A: Yeah, okay, that's true.
Speaker A: So we have a menu button and a...
Speaker C: Okay, in Beck.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay, in Beck.
Speaker B: Yeah, our confirm and back.
Speaker C: The four arrows.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: But those are still doubly used.
Speaker B: Should we save this picture or, you know, what it looks like?
Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not clear about the extra two buttons.
Speaker A: We have a menu button.
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: Just to activate the screen.
Speaker C: Yeah, okay.
Speaker C: So...
Speaker C: So you button access the menu in the LCD screen.
Speaker B: And then with these buttons, you can navigate.
Speaker B: You navigate.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: But you can also navigate the channels and the volume.
Speaker A: Okay, so that's not...
Speaker A: Yeah, those are both... both.
Speaker D: Hey, is it interesting for users if we put lead lights under the buttons so that if you...
Speaker D: Press on the menu function, that only the buttons that are used for the menu are...
Speaker D: Liden up, yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That's very good ID.
Speaker C: Five minutes.
Speaker B: All right.
Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good ID because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: And then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Sure.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: So...
Speaker B: Anything else?
Speaker B: Those buttons are lit up.
Speaker B: But just one thing.
Speaker B: Should we use those two then?
Speaker B: Or only this two to scroll?
Speaker B: And then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something.
Speaker B: Oh no, we have to use this to adjust...
Speaker D: Or some some bars.
Speaker D: Or keep it optional because maybe you can... you know, go left, right and up and down.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Maybe we should use this also as an okay button still.
Speaker B: And then just only a back button.
Speaker C: Well, we have those buttons.
Speaker D: The problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Sorry.
Speaker D: It's...
Speaker D: If you're pressing up and down, you can easily press it okay once you're not already at your...
Speaker A: Or maybe make one okay button...
Speaker A: And one back.
Speaker A: And one navigation button.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: With the channel and the volume.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: A multifunctional navigation button.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: That's what we decided.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: So...
Speaker C: You want to close down?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: I want to close down.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: Not because it doesn't like you.
Speaker C: But we have lunch break already.
Speaker C: And then we can work for 30 minutes.
Speaker C: We'll have to write very fast to make the minute.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: And then we'll see.
Speaker D: Alright.
Speaker D: How long is the lunch break?
Speaker C: I don't know.
Speaker C: We have to ask all of me.
Speaker A: Do we have to write down our stuff now?
Speaker A: First lunch break.
Speaker A: I believe that's first lunch break.
Speaker A: Everything in my head now.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: There you go.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: I think you can put a laptop back in the room.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yes, sir.
Speaker C: Time pressure.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot of pressure.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: Sorry for my not finished presentation.
Speaker D: Sorry.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: We'll kick your ass later.
Speaker B: Bring it on.
Speaker B: I don't know if it works.
Speaker B: You saved it.
None: That's safe.
None: Out of my head.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: We'll see.
Speaker B: Just shoot back my laptop.
Speaker B: Smart board.
Speaker B: Alright.
Speaker B: You can use it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: You can open it with picture preview or stuff like that.
Speaker A: Some maps with all the data we have.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: I tried to organize it by these three.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: It's just my own map.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: I don't really mind.
Speaker C: I just put the minutes here.
Speaker C: We'll see.
Speaker A: But you've got some actual information.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: That's in the functional design.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's just basically what I just showed.
Speaker A: Where do you get?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: I got it by the only one.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: I'm glad you're here.
Speaker C: I don't do it.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Alright.
None: Yeah.
Speaker C: Make me proud.
Speaker D: I'll try to.
Speaker D: So first we have a lunch break now.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Alright.
Speaker C: I believe so.
Speaker C: Oh, just ask.
Speaker D: Mm-hmm.
Speaker D: I don't know where she's at though.
None: Okay.
